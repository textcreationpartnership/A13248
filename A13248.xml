            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Three things did chiefly encourage me to publiſh it vnder the glorious name of your gracious Highneſſe: The firſt is, in regard of your Highneſſe deepe deſire to gaine experience in all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the which is ſeene by jour Graces fauouring and furthering any man which is endued with any good quality, therein rightly reſembling a branch of the ſame Stocke from whence your Excellency ſprang, of whom in my next Epiſtle to the Reader I will ſpeake more at large: But at this time for doubt of beeing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, with the renewing of olde griefes, I ſtand in a maze, like vnto that childe,
<pb facs="tcp:1116:3"/>who being asked whether he loued his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his mother beſt, ſtood mute as dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bting how to anſwer for feare of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the one of them: euen ſo in this place will J.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N ſetting out of a booke, friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, this I know, that there is no better a thing to be obſerued then order, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be an order in all things, all runneth to confuſion, but what doe I meane to talke of orders, which am no Scholler, nor haue no learning; but only a little experience, which God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beſtowed vpon me. As it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to build a Chuch without lyme or ſtone, no more can a workman worke without tooles, yet to auoide idleneſſe, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I will make of it, although I cannot make it ſound to ſo good a tune as I would, for want of learning, for I was neuer at <hi>Oxford</hi> but while I baited my horſe; nor at <hi>Cambridge</hi> but while one <hi>Sturbridge</hi> faire laſted: wherefore if you doe examine mee concerning learning, I ſhall anſwer you as the fellow did the gentleman, who asking him the way to <hi>London,</hi> a poke full of plumbes ſir ſaid he; or as he which came from a Sermon was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what he heard there; he ſaid it was a good Sermon, and the Preacher ſpake well, but he could not tell one word what hee ſaid, no more can I anſwer one word ſcholler-like or according to learning; yet both at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> I looked vpon the Schollers, and they looked vpon me, and ſo I became a little the older, but neuer the wiſer; wherefore if I ſhould continue tempering this booke ſo long till I had put it in order, I ſhould reſemble thoſe, which doe make their apparell ſo long of the neweſt faſhion, vntil they are quite out of faſhion, or like as the fidlers doe their ſtrings, who wreſt them and temper them ſo long, vntill they bring them out of all time, tune, and reaſon, leaſt I ſhould doe ſo I will let it goe with this drafte as it is: but gentle Reader looke not heere to gather grapes of thornes, nor figs of thiſtles: nor of a wild and a barren tree, nothing elſe but
<pb facs="tcp:1116:5"/>wilde and barren fruit, yet amongſt duſt, ſometimes there are pearles found, and in hard rockes gold and ſtones of great price, I haue heere as it were mixed wheat and rye, barlye and oates, Beanes and Peaſe altogether, now take a little paines to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that graine which thou likeſt beſt for thine owne benefit. I giue thee here a friendly caueat, to prepare thy ſelfe in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for although thou art at quiet now, yet doſt thou not know how ſoone thou ſhalt be vrged to take weapons in hand, as my ſelfe and many others haue beene, when I leaſt thought vpon it, therefore to haue iudgement and skill in weapons is good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou neuer haue occaſion to vſe it. The Prouerbe ſaith cunning is no burthen, the ſame mouth which at one time ſaith, I will liue quietly, for I will make no brawles with any, yet at another time he again will ſay, oh that I had skill, for then wold I bee reuenged on ſuch a one that hath iniuriouſly wronged me. Therfore for ſuch a cauſe be prepared before hand, for if the King were ſure that he ſhould neuer haue wars, what neede had he then to prouide armour and weapons, but in the time of peace hee prouideth himſelfe; the wiſe Mariner prouides in a calme for a ſtorme, for things doubtfull are to be dreadfull. It is better to liue in feare then in ſecurity, and to this purpoſe <hi>Tully</hi> hath a prety ſaying which goeth thus; <hi>hee which deſireth peace let him prouide for wars,</hi> but I feare mee that the tyde will be ſpent, before I can double this point, and therefore here I will caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and will ride in this rode ſomething longer then I would, for feare leaſt I caſt my barke away on a lee ſhore, for want of water; theſe words of warineſſe doe I vſe becauſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which no ſooner out of the ſhell, but are caſt away like an addle egge.</p>
            <p>Therefore I would not haue yong ſprigs ſpoiled in the blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, I meane I would not haue yong branches or young enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres into the world imbarke themſelues in the ſhip of fooles, for feare leaſt they caſt themſelues away in a manner, before they haue had any beginning, for I haue knowen many blaſted in the budding in a manner, before they came to know cheeſe from chalke: onely for want of inſtruction, and likewiſe ſome againe haue periſhed, and yet not for want of inſtruction, but they haue knowen what was good for them, and yet would not ſeek
<pb facs="tcp:1116:5"/>it, but haue delaid the meanes, as many delay their repentance, till the latter day, or till it be too late, not much vnlike a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, which rowſing himſelfe, and looking abroad in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he ſeeth that it is high time to riſe, yet ſluggiſhly he lyeth downe againe to ſleepe, and ſo forgetteth himſelfe; euen ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny periſh, ſome for want of good counſell, and ſome for lacke of forecaſting a miſchiefe before it doe light vpon them. It is ſaid that we muſt not tempt God. <hi>Math.</hi> 4. but I hold it a tempting of God to preſume wholly vpon him for all occaſions whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, without ſeeking other meanes which is commonly known, and by God prepared for vs: as if we were ſicke men we ought to take the Phyſitians counſell, and if wounded we muſt ſeeke for helpe of a Chyrurgian, if our houſe be on fire we muſt powre on water, and if we fall in a ditch, we muſt not lye ſtill without vſing other meanes beſides, ſaying God helpe vs, but for this and all other things God hath appointed meanes, we muſt ſeek and then no doubt God will giue his bleſſing with it, but wee muſt not preſume how careleſly ſoeuer we liue, or how deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſoeuer we dye, nothing can hinder vs of our ſaluation, but ſo far deceiued I feare me are ſuch, that there is a thunderbolt of miſchiefe prepared for their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce herein. Our Sauior Chriſt would not preſume ſo much of the mercy of God the Father, as when he was vpon the pinacle to caſt himſelfe downe, but hee came downe by other meanes, for the ſtayres were made for the purpoſe; God the father might otherwiſe haue ſaued <hi>Noah</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Arke if it had pleaſed him, but <hi>Noah</hi> had warning that ſuch a thing ſhould be, whereupon he ſought a meanes to ſaue himſelfe by making the Arke, therefore he that will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before hand with oyle in his Lampe, or with skill in his weapons, when there is meanes to be found, he may be ſhut out of heauen as the fiue fooliſh virgins were if hee chance to bee ſlaine ſuddenly, as many a man hath been, by dying without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>Indeed if there were no meanes then if we did with humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe come vnto God, no doubt then I ſay but God would mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly defend his ſeruants, as hee did the children of Iſrael when their enemies were behind them, and the red ſea before them, then there was no meanes nor helpe left them, but only in
<pb facs="tcp:1116:6"/>the Lord, but then the Lord ſtopped not his eares nor ſhortned not his armes, but gaue them paſſage with his outſtretched arm thorow the red ſea, and then againe they being in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, there was neither meate nor drinke, and then and there againe the Lord ſent them foode from heauen, and he alſo made the hard rockes guſh foorth riuers of water. The Mariner in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe throweth ouer boord the Marchants goods which are in ſhip, and yet then finding ſmall hope of life he cutteth down the maſts of the ſhip, and ſo he throweth them and the ſayles ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, which ſhould be the onely meane to bring them to land, but then theſe Mariners being bereft of al hope, they rely whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon God, which neuer leaueth in diſtreſſe thoſe which truſt in him, but then he miraculouſly doth defend them, and bring them into a ſafe harbor contrary vnto mans expectation.</p>
            <p>So not onely here in this place, but as I goe on I will ſhew ſome examples out of the booke of God and from the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and other Schoole men, and the application to be applied vnto our ſelues, for there is nothing written but hath beene written for our learning, and of thoſe we are to learne counſell of which haue runne through the brambles, briers, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of the world.</p>
            <p>Then be not wiſe in thine owne conceit, for S. <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that the wiſe are catched in their owne craftineſſe. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 13.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. If the wiſe are catched what then will become of the ignorant and fooliſh, not onely of this profeſſion, but of all ethers; for there are many of all trades which doe thinke their owne wit beſt, and hating to bee reformed, but I wiſh ſuch to take heede of ignorance pitfall, leaſt they fall into the ſpringle with the woodcocke; for who is ſo bold as blind bayard. But as ſome men of all trades with ſmall skill doe goe on and liue by their trades and yet in a manner but botchers, euen ſo I haue often hard many a man ſay, that with a little skill they haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their liues being put vnto tryall, for thoſe which are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of drowning will catch at a ſtraw to ſaue their liues, but for the moſt part it ſo falleth out, that if the father or the maſter be a coward, or vnskilfull in his weapons, then the ſonnes of that Father or the ſeruants of that Maſter, ſeldome prooue good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, not much vnlike that ſaying of the Prophet when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:1116:6"/>is an Hitite, and the Father an Ammorite, the child ſeldome prooues an Iſraelite. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 45. Then we muſt not follow or goe on being led on blindfoldly, by a cowardly ſort of people, which will ſay that a good eye or a good heart is all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto the defence of a mans body, theſe are they which profeſſing themſelues to be wiſe, are become fooles. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22. Or they may be compared vnto thoſe which talke of <hi>Robin hood</hi> and yet neuer ſhot in his bow, ſo this trumpe haue I caſt in your way,<note place="margin">Then ſhew not thy ſelfe worſe then a beaſt, for beaſt haue wit to find out reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to couer their griefe.</note> for loath I am to leaue you any ſtarting holes to wind out at, but that you may keepe the high beaten way, leaſt in ſeeking by-wayes you wander quite out of the way, yet miſtake me not in thinking that hereby I ſeeme to hale thee on for thy owne good, like a beaſt, for I doe but lead thee with the cords of loue, and wiſh thee to taſte of this my opinion which I haue new broached. And I make no doubt but in tryall it will be no whit diſtaſting vnto thee, for by experience I ſpeake it that aboue all, skill is the key of the worke, as the eye to the body, or as the Captaine to the ſouldiers, or the pilot to the ſhip; if the eye bee darke in walking, the body falleth, if the Captaine be ignorant, then doe the Souldiers march diſorderly, or if the Pilot bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull, the ſhip ſailes in danger, but as I was about to tell you of a ſort of logger-headed aſſes which further more will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their familiar friends, by telling them that skill will doe them no good, for when they haue learned skill and afterwards when they ſhall haue occaſion to vſe their weapons, then ſuch dunces will ſay that skill will be forgoten &amp; little thought vpon. Alſo they ſay that a man with a ſword will cut off thy rapier at one blow, but I ſay this is a moſt cowardly kind of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for if a skilfull man doe hold the rapier, it is not a hundred blows with a ſword can doe a rapier any harme, no although they light vpon him. Therefore thoſe which will perſwade any from lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning skill with weapons, for the defence of their bodies, may fitly be compared vnto the falſe Prophets amongſt the Iewes, which perſwaded them that they ſhould not feare nothing, but peace, peace, peace, when the Aſſyrians were in a readineſſe to cut their throats as in the 6 of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the 14, there you may read it, therefore a prouident care ought to bee had, as <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> did when he feared the Moabits to come vpon him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3.
<pb facs="tcp:1116:7"/>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> liued ſecurely in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and without feare, which made him forget God, as in the 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. the whole Chapter is worth the reading; doth not the wiſeſt man that euer wrote ſay, that there is a time of war and a time of peace, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 3.8. If a man did know what howre the theefe would come, he would ſurely watch, wherefore be aduiſed to deale wiſely, but not like vnto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for he ſaid, let vs deale wiſely when he dealt moſt foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly <hi>Exodus</hi> 1.10. and ſo we will goe on.</p>
            <p>In reading ouer diuers Hyſtories I thereby vnderſtanding the noble acts, and alſo noting the manly mind of theſe who liued many hundred yeeres agoe, whoſe fame ſhall neuer dye, whereas cowardly daſtards which neuer bent their ſtudies in marſhall exploits, ſuch I ſay at their death their fame dyeth with them, and ſo they are quickly raked vp in the aſhes of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and buried in the valley of obliuion. So that if a man wold goe ſearch for the pedigree of their gentility, they ſhall finde it laid vp in a beggars box, or as the Charter of a City written in duſt, whereas on the other ſide the valiant and gallant minded men, although they dye, yet in their life time their manly acts and valiant deedes which they worthily performed, ſome in the warres and ſome at ſingle combat, and ſome at other honorable and laudable exerciſes, whereby they merited to themſelues im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall fame for euer, for to ſome no exerciſe nor weapon came amiſſe as in ſtead of many examples theſe two out of the book of God ſhall be ſufficient, <hi>Dauid</hi> with his ſling, (as <hi>Hercules</hi> with his Club) and <hi>Sampſon</hi> with his Iaw-bone or any other weapon which came next to his hand, but loth I am to trouble you with ſo long an Epiſtle or Preface, yet for an Introduction to the reſt ſomething I muſt ſay and moſt of that which I haue and will ſay is ſo neceſſary as the reſt, although it be longer then I would, but we will now to the matter.</p>
            <p>Then thus, by reaſon of diuers errors which are in ſundry mens teaching of this noble arte of defence, I therefore being pricked forward by the earneſt requeſt of ſome of my friends, to deſcribe the rules of weapons, which I by my ſtudy haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, and by practiſe brought to perfection, and likewiſe for my countries benefit, I meane to better the vnskilfull in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I haue thought it good to open plainly the beſt grounds,
<pb facs="tcp:1116:7"/>which belongeth to our Engliſh weapons, that are now in vſe, ſo far as my ſimple inuention by great practice hath attained vnto. Another reaſon which moued me hereunto was where ſome doe find out many hidden ſecrets which they bury in the earth againe with their bodies, or elſe if they make it known, it ſhall bee to ſuch a faithfull friend as they loue and affect dearely, all writers that euer wrote did write either for profit or pleaſure: ſome to profit others, and ſome to pleaſure themſelues; and ſome haue wrote common and neceſſary things for their owne poſterity after them; I write but of common things, yet not ſo common as neceſſary, and therefore my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to make my ſecret ſtudy known ſo plainly as I can vnto all the world, for the benefit of many thouſand yet vnborne, for euery man hath or ſhould haue skill in his weapons, the reaſons ſhall follow, as occaſion ſhall ſerue hereafter more at large; but as yet I know the greateſt number are blinded in an ignorant conceit, I meane ſuch as doe thinke to ouercome their enemies if occaſion doe ſerue by quickneſſe of the eye, or by a kind of valorous reſolution, which for the auoiding of this and ſuch like abuſes, I haue here and there put downe ſundry reaſons in this booke, although they be not in order, yet take a little paines to ſeeke them out, for I wrote this booke at ſuch leaſurable fits as time would permit me; now for affection ſake ſome will ſay it is well done, and others againe will ſay it is reaſonable and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſo I pray you let it paſſe, for if I ſhould perceiue it ſhold goe for ſtarke nought, then ſhould I account my time and labor very ill beſtowed; but yet this I know, if it were ten times worſe then it is, yet would it be welcom to a number of my old friends and familiar acquaintance, ſuch as were the cauſe of this my idle time ſpending, who were earneſt with me for the ſetting foorth of this worke. Lo this is the anchor whereon my hope depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, but yet I make a doubt leaſt that my booke may light into the hands of ſome enuious mates, who neuer knew me, yet will not ſticke to ſay vpon the very firſt fight, oh this is ſuch a mans worke, I know well enough what hee could doe, and yet will not fully giue vp their verdit, but onely ſhake the head, with a wry mouth and a ſmiling countenance, throwing it from them, and ſo ſeeming by their ſilence that they could further
<pb facs="tcp:1116:8"/>diſgrace mee, but will not. Indeed it is a more eaſier matter for ſuch to find fault with a part of my booke then to amend the whole, but I could wiſh ſuch learne before they take vpon them to controule, but thoſe which are wiſe and kind, will accept of my good will, for I haue giuen out this but as a theame; let a wiſer then I rime vpon it, and although it ſeeme but as it were a glimpſe of the noble Art of defence, in regard of the ſubſtance, yet ſome will perceiue day at a little hole; wherefore trauell fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it, till you find out the ſubſtance, like a good Surgion ſearch the wound to the bottome before thou lay a plaſter, I meane reade it ouer before thou giue iudgement; and then play the wiſe mans part which is to ſpeake little, although he thinke much; indeed I muſt confeſſe a vanity in my ſelfe and that I haue deſerued blame, becauſe ſo bluntly I haue ſet foorth ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſerued peece of worke, but my reaſons in the latter end of the book may a litle excuſe me, but in the mean while let it be neuer the worſe welcome vntothee, for that it hath my poore name vnto it, I ſpeake this becauſe I know there are ſome will ſpeake they care not what, to diſgrace they know not whom, without rendring any reaſon at all, out onely out of a dogged humor, or an idle braine, ſome finding fault with the gards, and ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue written of things which belongeth not to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ground of this worke, and ſome becauſe <hi>it is a booke of pictures,</hi> accounting a book of pictures fit for children and fools; to anſwer ſuch I ſay when a child or a foole doth looke in a glaſſe, he doth thinke there is a baby on the other ſide, but when men of diſcretion looke in a glaſſe, they do not think ſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by the Heathen we may learne many good leſſons, euen ſo a man of vnderſtanding may learne wiſedome, and gaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a foole; I wrote not this altogether to pleaſure thoſe that are skilfull already, for this booke can ſteed them but little, for the whole and ſound need not a Phyſition, but the ignorant and vnskilfull may profit by this booke as much if with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they take regard in their practiſe according to my directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if my ſelfe were in perſon to teach them, but both the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vnskilfull, the wiſe and the fooliſh may here learne one leſſon or other, which they neuer learned before; yet I know not how euery one will take this my preſumption, in aduenturing
<pb facs="tcp:1116:8"/>to ſet out a booke hauing no learning, yet I pray you reade it ouer firſt, and then iudge, but yet be ſlow in condemning mee, for I haue done my good will, now he which can make a ſimple thing better, he ought ſo to handle the matter, that although he get credit himſelfe, yet condemne not me for ſhewing the beſt I could; therefore ſo iudge of mee behind my backe as you would haue others iudge of you, but if you iudge well and like well of it, then ſhall you haue the ſecond part with ſix weapons more, but I will firſt ſee what will become of this firſt part, let it commend or condemne it ſelfe, for great braggers cannot better it, nor diſſembling ſpecches impaire it, neither will I maintaine for well done, all that I haue done, but if you accept it then I haue all my deſire, if otherwiſe good will ſhall beare the blame for my preſumption: but why doe I make a dought of any euill ſpeeches, which deſerus no blame, againe this I know that there is none which ſtandeth in ſo much need of good words as thoſe which goe about to couer diſhoneſt deeds, wherefore I may ſay as that great Captaine <hi>Marius</hi> who hauing occaſion to vſe a ſpeech before the people of Rome, in his concluſion hee ſaid, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my words are not well ſet in order I waigh not ſo much ſo that my deeds be good.</p>
            <p>I haue made this of bricke and ſtones, as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt, but now Rome is built with marble: euen ſo I wold wiſh that ſome expert and learned perſon or other would pull downe this rude begun worke of mine and build it vp with marble, for the worke it ſelfe if it were workmanlike handled, deſerueth to be written in leters of gold, and to remain for euer, but firſt it muſt be twice or thrice diſtilled as they doe their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſolis, for firſt it is Aquavitae, &amp; then in the ſecond and third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, there is beſtowed greater charge and more excellent matter ariſeth of it.</p>
            <p>I haue but roued at skill in weapons, yet I am ſure that I haue ſhot ſo neere the marke that ſome will account me for a good Archer, otherwiſe they would neuer haue beene ſo important with me to haue me put my directions in writing, and when it was in writing ſo many deſired Copies, that amongſt ſo many friends I knew not which to pleaſure firſt, but eſpecially and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the late high and mighty Prince <hi>Henry</hi> whom I well
<pb facs="tcp:1116:9"/>hoped that he ſhould haue liued to haue beene the ninth <hi>Henry</hi> and the tenth worthy of the world, for what did any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nine worthies doe, but this good Prince was as likely, if he had liued to haue performed as much as any of them; for what hath beene done but may be done againe. But as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſay, this good Prince had the peruſing of this book and earneſtly perſwaded me to print it, but I had not leiſure to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it before death vntimely tooke him away to my griefe and many more, for all the whole kingdome was nothing but mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Death were kind if he tooke none, but thoſe which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but oh moſt vnkind death, for thou in taking away that good yong Prince, haſt taken away him which neuer offended, for there was neuer the like ſeene in one ſo yong, for his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, and kind curteſie, to all which came to ſee his Princely ſelfe, talking ſo mildly and familiarly to euery one which did ſo reioyce and glad the hearts of all true and louing ſubiects, and alſo cauſed him in his fame to be ſpoken of, for Kings and Princes are talked of at poore mens tables, and good words he deſerued, as euer any earthly creature did. For beſides his skill in Muſicke, hee was able by his learning to diſcourſe with any forraine Prince whatſoeuer, alſo his admirable and well riding of a great horſe, and his excellent running at tilt or ring; likewiſe his cunning in weapons, for the fight on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe or on foote, and for toſſing the pike neuer ſo many feates ſeene in any Prince, inſomuch that it made ſtrangers ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to behold him; at a word hee had experience in all artes or ſciences, thereby ſeeming as it were deſirous to truſt more to his owne valour, if occaſion ſerued, then to the goodneſſe of his horſe. And ſo to make an end leaſt of the ignorant I get the name of a claw-blacke, and alſo another doubt I haue, leaſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſo difficult a taske, and being not able to diſcharge it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the dignity and worthineſſe thereof, the which I cannot doe, and therefore I will not wade ſo far in ſo dangerous a riuer, but that I may eaſily eſcape out, wherefore like the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a diall I will point, it muſt be the clocke which telleth you the iuſt time of the day, I haue drawne his Highneſſe in bare colours, and ſo I leaue the oily colours vnto thoſe which are learned, you may ſee by a taſt what wine is in the butte, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:1116:9"/>to our matter againe. Now he which will practiſe after my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, thou maiſt a little the rather attaine vnto that perfect knowledge in the Art or skill with thy weapons hauing an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body by agility to preſerue that skill which I haue here in this booke laid open vnto thee, for I did vnderſtand many things which my body was not able to performe; now becauſe many at the firſt will waxe weary in their practiſe, yet ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe is ouercome by often exerciſe, and that new skill once obtained will be ſuch a pleaſure to thee,<note place="margin">Giue not ouer practice nor reiect not skill becauſe thou canſt not be a maſter of art, or a doctor at the firſt day, for time muſt worke and bring al things to passe, for that is well done which is done by lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for haſt many times makes waſt.</note> that it putteth all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe out of thy remembrance, now vntill thou haſt skill thou muſt not thinke it a toyle, but ſtriue continually to ouercome wearineſſe: reſolue this with thy ſelfe, that the paine will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo weariſome as the gaine of skill will be delightfull and comfortable vnto thee, and commendable amongſt others: I haue made it as plaine and laid it as open as I can expreſſe by words, becauſe I would haue euery man expert in weapons, conſidering that skill in weapons is ſo honourable and ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing, that in my mind it may be preferred next vnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, for as diuinity preſcrueth the ſoules of thoſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, from hell and the diuell, ſo doth this noble and worthy art of defence defend the body from hurts and skars of thoſe which learne it, but thoſe which neither follow the one nor learne the othet, the firſt fort for ought I know may goe throw fire brands in hell, and the ſecond ſort may ſit in an alehouſe, and there ſhew how many hurts, and likewiſe tell how many wounds he hath about his body; for I haue known wany brag of their hurts, and in my conceit they take a pride In that they haue ſtood ſo neere the point of a weapon, whereby to receiue wounds, therefore they are willing that the world ſhould know how venturous they haue been, but now in my minde if they had skill they need not bee hurt: wherefore skill is not onely auaileable to preſerue and keepe the body without hurts and wounds, but alſo the vſe and practiſe with weapon, doth driue away all aches, griefes, and diſeaſes, it remooueth congealed blood, and breaketh impoſtumes, it maketh the body nimble, and plyant, it ſharpneth the wit, it increaſeth the ſight, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth ſtrength, and expelleth melancholy and cholericknes, and many other euil conceits, it keepeth a man in breath, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:1116:10"/>health, it makes him to be of longe life which vſeth it, it is vnto him which hath the perfect skil in weapons, a moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; comfortable companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when he is alone, hauing but only his weapons about him, it putteth him out of all feare, and in the wars and places of moſt danger it maketh a man bold, hardy valiant, and venturous. wherefore they that are once experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the skill of weapons will afterwards to the end of their liues enconrage the vnskilfull to learne ſtill, conſidering how neceſſary a thing skill in weapons is, inſomuch that God and nature tollerates the practiſe of this skill in weapons, which is here ment for the defence of mans body, it alſo preſerueth many from murder, alſo in the wars it may likewiſe ſtead a King, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or any other priuate ſouldier; for if in the wars a ſingle combat is deſired, as that of <hi>Golias,</hi> there ſtarted out of the army a <hi>Dauid</hi> who with a godly valour ſtood in the gap, for the good and preſeruation of many mens liues, which no doubt elſe had periſhed in that great and dangerous battell. Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth Kings being challenged by their equalls for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and good of their ſubiects and country, to aduenture and hazard their owne liues in hope of a conqueſt, ſo that thereby the wars may ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Some there are which take delight to talke of the arte of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and yet haue no inſight nor iudgement therein, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is verified in ſuch which goeth thus, there are ſome which talke of <hi>Robin-hood</hi> which neuer ſhot in his bowe, I ſpeake this becauſe a gentleman on a time came to my Schoole and would not play by no meanes, yet he was buſie with his tongue in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching others, and in diſcourſing of ſeuerall weapons, and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall guards, but by his words he bewraied his ſmall iudgement, for his ſpeech founded to no ſence nor reaſon, and ſo I being weary with hearing him talke ſo long, and far from the marke which he aimed at, ſo at length I rounded him in the eare, thus, hold your peace, or elſe ſpeake ſoftly, for my vſher laughs you to skorne. But we will to our matter againe, and draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this Epiſtle, for the neceſſary vſe of weapons. In <hi>Luke</hi> the twelue there the Lord as it ſeemeth did thinke them to be more better then a coate vpon a mans backe, he therefore bade his Diſciples generally, goe ſaid he, ſell your coates and buy you
<pb facs="tcp:1116:10"/>ſwords, he ſpake not this to one of them alone, but vnto them all.</p>
            <p>Now the Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth you where to weare your ſwords, ſaying gird thy ſword on thy thigh, hee doth not bid thee weare it about thy necke in a ſtring, euen ſo as the Lord in many places of the Bible is ſaid to be of many profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for he is called a ſhepheard, a husband-man, a Phyſition, and <hi>Dauid</hi> in his 144. Pſalme, in a manner calleth him a fenſer, for there he faith that the Lord did teach his hands to war, and his fingers to fight: He alſo faith in another of his Pſalmes, I am a worme and no man, and yet I feare not what man can doe vnto me. Other examples bending to this purpoſe hereafter ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low more at large, ſome in one Chapter, and ſome in another, as they come in my mind, and although it hath been my ſtudy and practiſe this twenty yeeres, yet now I haue vnfolded euery place, and ſhewed euery wrinkle of theſe few weapons, ſo far as my inuention hath attained vnto, and I haue ſet them downe ſo large and made them ſo plaine, as by words I could any way expreſſe them, ſo that thou maiſt learne them in twenty dayes and leſſe, if not all, yet enough for the ſure defence of thy body, and the reſt ſhall follow in a ſecond booke hereafter, if thou doſt friendly accept of this.</p>
            <p>In the meane time arme thy mind to theſe weapons here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, for they are ſufficient for thy defence at ſingle combat, alſo here thou ſhalt find other leſſons no leſſe profitable then delightfull, if thou with content peruſe them, and ſo I will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee no longer from that which enſueth, and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my Epiſtle with theſe words of the Frier, who often in his Sermon ſaid the beſt is behind, ſo he that readeth but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a booke, can giue no iudgement of that which enueth; then read it ouer, and thou ſhalt not be deluded with the beſt is behind.</p>
            <p>I hope I may cal this booke a booke without any offence, for the collier he calleth his horſe a horſe, and the Spaniſh Iennet is but a horſe. Now as this art is called a Noble arte, and not ſo named vnfittingly, being rightly vnderſtood, for there is no art nor ſcience more to bee preferred before this, for that there is none that iumpeth in equality, nor that matcheth in ſingularity
<pb facs="tcp:1116:11"/>or that hath ſo many ſundry ſubtill deuices and ingenious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, as this noble art of defence hath. Now hee that doth but read of this art, yea although he read neuer ſo much, yet without practiſe and by experience in triall, it will be vnperfect, for how can perfection be attained but by practiſe, and therfore it alſo behooueth thee to vſe practiſe with ſundry men, and ſo to make vſe of the diuerſity of each mans skill, and then for thy benefit, like the wiſe phyſition who of many ſimples maketh one compound, or as the bee which by her ſerious induſtry ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth vertue from ſundry ſorts of hearbs and flowers, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh her hony, ſhe is not therefore to be condemned of enuy, but rather to be commended of all.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I write this booke altogether to profit thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learning that which they before wanted, but only to ſet them and other willing minds a work which by arte and learning can better ſwim through ſuch a deepe riuer then I can, it ſhould haue been better if my learning had been anſwerable to my wil, yet hoping that the wiſe will rather winke at ſmall faults, then raſhly reproue that which may profit the ſimple, for all haue not skill and cunning alike, I am perſwaded that ſome will the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſe it ouer with patience, although it be but only for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the arte, and ſo hoping that this my worke may bee profitable to all, for ſo it can no way be hurtfull to none, but if you chance to meete with this booke after he hath ſerued out the apprentiſhip of ſeauen yeeres, if God grant me life ſo long you ſhall ſee him in double apparell, and then you ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to ſay that his maſter hath fulfilled his couenants, for I wiſh all men well, and euery one an increaſe of skill in all lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable arts or ſciences, and ſo with this long entry into a little parlor, I leaue you to him whoſe ſeate is in heauen, and whoſe foot-ſtoole is the earth.

Alas, I pray you conſider and remember, that as the tree groweth, ſo he falleth; we are not borne for our ſelues, but for our Countrie: and if we doe no good, though wee doe no harme, then better it were that wee had neuer beene borne. The figge tree in the Goſpell, is ſaid to trouble the ground, becauſe he bare no fruite, and therefore bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an addle Egge then an ill Bird; for a good and a godly life, hath a good and a godly end, and an vngodly life hath an vngodly end: and therefore moſt happie dieth that man, of whom the world doubteth not of his ſaluation, although the world is giuen to ſpeake well and charitably of the wicked when they are dead, and yet it may be they thinke in their
<pb facs="tcp:1116:12"/>mindes they are gone to hell; then call to minde, and wiſely conſider of this, and alſo of your end, and in what great ieopardie your liues ſtand; for he that to day is well, luſtie, and ſtrong, may the next day, nay, the next houre, haue his life taken ſodainely from him at vnawares, when he leaſt thinketh on is, for many of this profeſsion doe not liue out halfe their daies, for there is many waies to bring a man to his end, ſome by quarrelling when they haue no cauſe, and ſo are ſtabbed ſodainely, and ſome by drunkenneſſe, as you ſhall heare anone; for I could write of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which came to their ends, and yet died not all in their beddes, nor all in the warres, nor all at the gallowes, and yet many of them haue gone theſe waies: for there are wicked and euill angells which are the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and doe attend vpon an vngodly life, for Death reſpecteth no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſon, for be doth aſſault the skilfull ſo well as the ignorant, the wiſe ſo well as the fooliſh, and therefore it is good for euerie man to bee prepared and in a readineſſe, and then hee neede not to feare to ſay, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickely;</hi> to day or to morrow, or when thou wilt, and with what manner of death ſoeuer, ſo it come by thine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>And now (for examples ſake) I thinke it not amiſſe to renew your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance with the death of ſome few of the Noble Science, becauſe I haue knowne their ends; and firſt, to beginne with that one of maiſter <hi>Turner,</hi> which ſhould be the laſt, he did not ſo ſpeedily kill <hi>Iohn Dun,</hi> with a thruſt in the eie, but he was as ſoone murthered afterwards, with a ſhotte of a Piſtoll; for neither of them, after they had their deaths wound, ſpake one word; loe, by this you may ſee, that ſome hawkes are but a flight, and ſome horſes are killed with a tournie, and a man is but a ſhotte; but now, by reaſon that Maiſter <hi>Turner,</hi> by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie hand, thruſt out two or three eies, and becauſe none others are knowne to doe the like, it bath therefore bred an admiration in the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and vulgare ſort, inſomuch, that generally they doe applaude him with this commendation, ſaying that hee hath not left the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, nor neuer will be the like againe: But this is a great errour in thinking ſo, and farre deceiued are they; for I well knew Maiſter <hi>Turner</hi> by familiar acquaintance, and therefore (to ſpeake the right) he was a worthy fellow and deſerued well, but yet I know many which can goe ſo neare the eie as euer he could doe, if they ſo liſted, as in this booke you ſhall ſee many falſe thruſts at ſeuerall weapons, which may
<pb facs="tcp:1116:12"/>endanger any mans eies, if thoſe which learne them doe carry enuious mindes, or if they were deſirous to worke a man ſuch a miſchiefe, but God forbid that any man ſhould be ſo ill minded. I will not ſay, but that by chaunce ſuch a thing may be done, and ſo it may bee that Maiſter <hi>Turner</hi> did it more by chaunce, without any intention; for ſo ſome do iudge of it: but if a man choppe a thruſt at the face, yet, by chaunce, he may hit the eye: for no man is certaine, that with the firſt thruſt he will hit the eie, but with proffering many, by chance he may: now the vſe which we ought to make of this, is, to aduiſe all men to take heed that they beare not a killing heart, for then we ſhall haue no killing hand, as that example more of <hi>Henry Adlington</hi> for killing his Maiſter <hi>Iohn Deuell,</hi> was hanged: <hi>Furlong</hi> he drunke a pinte of Aqua vitae at one draught, and he fell downe and died preſently: <hi>Weſtcoat,</hi> for ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe receiued of his owne daughter, he went into a wood neare <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> in <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and there hanged himſelfe: <hi>Richard Caro,</hi> hee died moſt miſerably of the French diſeaſe in an olde houſe neare <hi>Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> although he had a new ſuite of clothes from toppe to toe, yet hee was ſo loathſome a creature, that no bodie would let him harbour in his houſe, for part of his body was rotten and ſtuncke aboue ground: alſo old <hi>Carter</hi> of <hi>Worceſter</hi> lay along time ſicke of a lingering diſeaſe, and being worne away to nothing but skinne and bones, hee died in his bed: and ſo of many more I could write, but it is not my intention to write a Chronicle, and therefore theſe few ſhall ſerue for this time, I wrote it but onely to put you in minde, that you may ſo leade your liues daily and hourely, as if Death were euen at your heeles, and ſo to liue as though you ſhould liue for euer, alwayes keeping ſomething for a rainie day, as ſaith the Prouerbe, that is to ſay, for ſickeneſſe, if God doe ſend it, and for olde age when your aking bones doe refuſe to performe that labour which the heart willing to ſet them to.</p>
            <p>Therefore I would wiſh euery one, in his youth, to prouide and get himſelfe a homely home, and to ſettle in one good towne or other, for a rowling ſtone gathereth no Moſſe; the Graſhopper cannot liue but in the graſſe, and the Salamander dieth if hee goe out of the fire: therefore, ſpend not thy time in trauell from place to place, but keepe thy homely home, and there beginne thy pending as thou maieſt continue, cutting thy coate according to thy cloth, and not ſpending all at one time, and haue nothing at an other to ſerue thy turne, as many of all Profeſſion do.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1116:13"/>
            <p> Wherefore, you yong branches of this noble Art of Defence, of you I meane to ſpeake, and vnto you I doe make this earnest request, that you will beſtow all your idle time, which too too many ſpend in idle companie, and in drunkenneſſe, ſuch ill ſpent time, I could wiſh, that it were either beſtowed in reading of good bookes, or in giuing good counſell vnto ſuch yong men as doe frequent your company, teaching them beſides skill with weapons, how to manage their weapons, and how, and when to appoint the field, but not vpon euery drunken quarrell, and chiefly of all, charging them from profaning the Sabboth day, drunkenneſſe, and all other vices belonging thereunto, which makes their white ſoules ſo blacke as incks, ſtinking before God as it were the ſmoake of ſulphure and brimſtone: and thus doing will purchaſe you, not onely the loue of God, but likewiſe of all the world, and your good report will be in euery mans mouth, yea it will goe before you in your trauells, like as with an Herauld of Armes, or elſe like a ſpeedy Poſte, ouertake you whereſoeuer you goe, whereas on the contrary ſide, thoſe which doe ſpend their dayes in drunkenneſſe, and leading their liues laſciuiouſly one miſfortune or other happeneth vnto them, eyther by the loſſe of a limbe, or by the loſſe of an eie, or by the loſſe of their liues.</p>
            <p>For I haue knowne many very skilfull men not only of this Profeſſion, but likewiſe of others, which delight in vngodlineſſe, drunkenneſſe; and being put to triall in their Art or Profeſſion, they haue receiued diſgrace and lost the day, and they afterwards haue thought that they made at good excuſe, in ſaying that they were in drinke when they went about their buſineſſe, and yet it may be it was not ſo, but admit it was ſo, then is it meere madnes, that any man ſhould be ſo fooliſh in taking too much drinke when before hand hee knoweth this is the day, wherein I am to ſtand vpon my credite; now becauſe I know, that many will reade this beſides thoſe vnto whom it is dedicated: therefore I wiſh all men, of what Profeſsion ſoeuer, to make this reckoning (as aforeſaid) euery day, and not to be forgetfull of that which hee ſhould chiefly remember; for euery day one time of the day or other thou mayst be put ſo to thy ſhifts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by haue an occaſion to ſommon vp all thy wittes, and driuen to vſe thy beſt skill, and yet all little enough to ſerue thy turne.</p>
            <p>Wherefore vnto you which this any way may concerne, I wiſh you to apply your ſelues vnto your Profeſsion, and ſtill to be ſtudying and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing the true and perfect rules belonging both to the true and falſe
<pb facs="tcp:1116:13"/>play, especially vnto ſuch weapons as you are not growne vnto the full perfection before hand, if they may ſerue eyther for the warres or for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle combate.</p>
            <p>Be not wiſe in thine owne conceit, in thinking that thou hast learned all the skill which is poſsible to be learned already , farre deceiued art thou if thou thinke ſo, for if thou liue till thou art olde, yet thou mayest learne ſtill, for one guard croſſeth another, and the falſe play croſſeth the true play; there are many ſecret ſlippes and guards to be inuented, and one guard or one tricke may more ſteade thee, and more preuaile against ſome men then another; for when with plaine play, thou canst not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger thy enemy, yet with falſe play thou mayest hit him, for although thy enemy doe know the defence of ſome manner of falſe play, yet it may be he is not acquainted, neither with the defence nor offence of thine, for there it more wayes to the wood then one, and hee which knoweth many wayes, may goe the nearest.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo, he that knoweth many guards, and the true skill at many weapons may be the better able to anſwere any ſtowt bragging forreiner or ſtranger when they come with their challenges into our country, let them be of what nation ſoeuer, and at what weapons they will, and vpon what tearmes they dare, as hitherto they haue beene ſufficiently anſwered during my time, by Maiſter <hi>Mathews,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Turner,</hi> Maister <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> and Maister <hi>Yates;</hi> for theſe chiefly ſtoode to ſtake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all commers, and yet I can not chuſe but remember Maister <hi>Church,</hi> and Maister <hi>Brentley,</hi> who of this latter time hane deſerued to be well reported of, and for aught that I could euer heare or ſee anie get at any of their hands, they haue ſmall cauſe to bragge of their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for they alwayes went away with ſhrewd ſhrubs and knockes, I meane with blacke eyes, broken ſhinnes, or crackt pates; but of my ſelfe I will ſay little, becauſe the world is ſufficiently ſatisfied of more then at this time I meane to write of now, although the ignorant can not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them for want of skill and iudgement, yet they will reioyce and clap their hands to ſee them anſwered by ſufficient and able men of valour and iudgement.</p>
            <p>Now if any ſhould aske my reaſon, why ſome ſhould haue ſuch good fortune, and other ſome diſgraced, and yet by the worlds iudgement their skill equall; becauſe you ſhall not muſt long about it, I will quickely tell you my opinion, good gouernement and good carriage is the maine point
<pb facs="tcp:1116:14"/>thereof, yet me thinkes amongst the vulgar ſort I heare ſome ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two or three famous fellowes are dead, that there will neuer be the like againe: but farre deceiued are they which thinke ſo, for there hath not beene ſo good, but there may come ſo good againe: for as yet I neuer knew any man but he hath mette with his match, and therefore I wiſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one not to preſume one ſteppe the higher, for any gift that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on thee, neither to thinke thy ſelfe better then any man, though there are ſome which, for want of diſcretion, will diſable others, onely to magnifie themſelues, and thinking thereby to make the world beleeue there is none ſo good as they. Loe, this is the cauſe of many quarrells, and ſometimes murthers: Therefore ſpeake not euill behinde the backe of anie man, nor dispraiſe no mans play nor workemanſhip, be it neuer ſo ſimple, doe not like other Tradeſmen, which cannot liue one by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but with a kinde of grudging hatred, as the Hatter against the Hatter, the Shoomaker againſt the Shoomaker, and the Tailer would euen hang the Tailer by his good will, and ſo of all Trades the like; but I would gladly wiſh it otherwiſe of all Trades, but eſpecially of this Profeſsion, to be louing and kinde one to another, meeting together in their trauells, and like Birds of a feather holde together, and in brotherly loue embrace one another, and let it not be from the teeth outward, but from the heart inward, for you ſhall haue many others which will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine you, and creepe into your ſecrets, and ſo runne betwixt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with tattling tales, onelie to ſet you together by the eares, and then laugh at you when they haue done: Loe, thus an euill tongue is the cauſe of many a mans death: wherefore leaue and forſake all euill vices, though you feare not man in respect of your manhoode, yet feare to offend God for doubt of his iudgements, which vndoubtedly lighteth vpon all thoſe that careleſly forget him.</p>
            <p>For, as the greatest honour that euer came to man, was through skill in weapons, and the greateſt downe-fall that euer came to man, was through pride of his manhoode, and in neglecting his duety towardes God: wherefore, as you worthily carrie the ſtile or title of Maisters of Defence by your Profeſsion, then be the ſame yon ſeeme to be, I meane, neuer leaue ſtudying and practiſing till you come to the ground, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you haue ſounded into the depth of your Art, for there are manie other principall points belonging to the warres, beſides, march, troupe, charge, and ſtand; euen ſo vnto a Maister of Defence belongeth the
<pb facs="tcp:1116:14"/>skill of many other weapons, beſides backe-ſword, ſword and dagger, rapier and dagger, and the ſtaffe: for, if hee bee not prouided with the skill of many other weapons, hee may be to ſeeke of his defence, if hee ſhould be challenged vnto ſome other weapons which hee is vnacquainted withall.</p>
            <p>Then hee is not worthie to be called a Maister of Defence, which cannot defend himſelfe at all weapons, especially againſt euerie ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man not profeſsing the Art of Defence, nor except hee can play with a Lyon, as well as with a Lambe, and ſometimes againe to play the Lambe ſo well as the Lyon; for hee that can not tell when to ſpare, and when to ſtrike; and hee which cannot defend himſelfe, cannot teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to defend themſelues, nor is hee not worthy to be called a Maister of Defence, but he that can doe it is worthie of that title; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greatly wronged of them which will call ſuch a one a Fencer, for the difference betwixt a Maister of Defence, and a Fencer, is as much as betweene a Muſitian and a Fidler, or betwixt a Merchant and a Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; it will not well pleaſe a Merchant to be called Pedler, yet the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſelleth the like wares as the Pedler doth: Is therefore a Merchant and a Pedler all one? No more is euery Fencer a Maister of Defence; nor euerie Fidler hath not skill in Pricke-ſong, and therefore no Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; if a man haue but tenne ſhillings worth of Pinnes, Points, and Inckle, hee may then be called a Pedler, but hee that hath a hundred ſortes of wares, ſhall ſcarce get the name to be called a Merchant, no more can hee which hath gotten a little more skill at three or foure wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons then euerie common man, yet hee may be to ſeeke of the true skill of many other weapons which belong vnto a Maiſter of Defence.</p>
            <p>Yet one thing more, which I had almoſt forgotten; vnto Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and vnto Vſhers of Schooles of this Proſeſsion, proffer no wrong to your Maisters neither in word nor deed, nor deny not your Tutors, but beare a heartie loue vnto him which hath brought you from nothing to ſomething, from a ſhadow vnto a ſubstance; Let not the Priest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that hee was a Clarke. I haue knowne many Schollers ſo good as their Maister, and (it may be) better, according to the Prouerbe, A man may make his owne dogge bite him; but in my minde, ſuch a dogge is worthy of a rope: make the application as you ſee occaſion. For I haue knowne many an vngratefull knaue eſcape the gallowes, by the meanes of an honest minded man; yet ſuch a knaue (vpon ſmall or no occaſion)
<pb facs="tcp:1116:15"/>hath afterwards gone about to hang ſuch a friend if he could, euen ſo ſome young lustie Schollers, when they haue gotten perfect skill, for lacke of witte, would offer to wrong their aged Maister, if they could: It is not ſtrange to finde one ſcabbed ſheepe in a whole flocke; nor it is no newes amongest many honest men, to finde a treacherous varlet, voyde of all honestie, feare, and witte. Now hauing no warrant to force you to follow my counſell, but onely in brotherly loue, I thought good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest you, and euerie of you, to amend one; and God amend vs all, he I meane, whoſe Seate is in Heauen, and whoſe Foote-ſtoole is the Earth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ECAVSE old weapons lyeth ruſty in a corner, and euery man is deſirous of the neweſt faſhion of weapons, eſpecially if they ſeeme to be of more daunger to the enemy then the old, therfore it is my intent &amp; purpoſe at this time to expreſſe and ſet downe both the true and falſe play principally of the rapier and dagger, and ſtaffe, for I hold that the skill of theſe two weapons are chiefly and neceſſary of euery man to be learned, for to haue the vſe of a rapier to ride with, and a ſtaffe to walke a foote withall, for thoſe which haue the skill of theſe two weapons may ſafely encounter againſt any man hauing any other weapon whatſoeuer as hereafter you ſhall be ſufficiently ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>But firſt a word by the way in commendations of thoſe two weapons, this I can ſay and by good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience I ſpeake it, that he which hath a rapier and a cloſe hilted dagger, and skill withall to vſe him hath great ods againſt the ſword and dagger, or ſword and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1116:17"/>buckler, and the like I doe affirme of a ſtaffe againſt all long weapons; my reaſons ſhall follow anon; but firſt I will ſpeake more in commendations of the rapier and dagger, note it well, for it is the fineſt &amp; the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euer was vſed in <hi>England,</hi> for ſo much cunning to this weapon belongeth as to no weapon the like: wherefore I would wiſh all gentlemen and others, not onely to learne the true and perfect skill thereof, but alſo to practiſe it often. For there is no exerciſe in the world ſo healthfull to the body, and the skill of it a ſure defence for the ſame, likewiſe it alſo behoueth euery man to be well inſtructed in this weapon, the rather, and for becauſe it is a weapon which for the moſt part all out-landiſh men doe vſe; wherefore being vnprepared thou maiſt be the better able to anſwer them at their owne weapon either in ſingle combat or otherwiſe, but if thou delay thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe till thou haſt need, then I ſay at the very time of need it will be too late, and little auaileable to thee, for being learned in ſuch haſte it is ſoone forgotten, and he which neuer learned, but doth truſt to his own cunning may ſoone loſe his life, for there is but two wayes for the doing of euery thing; that is to ſay ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a good or a bad, and commonly by nature euery man hath the worſt way; both at this exerciſe and ſo at all others the like, but the beſt way being learned, by a little practiſe keepeth it ſo perfect, that it is neuer forgotten againe.</p>
            <p>A Phyſitian is but little regarded, but in the time of ſickneſſe, euen ſo the practiſing of skill is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred vntill a man hath need to vſe it. <hi>Plato</hi> was a Diuine, yet he ſo highly eſteemed the art or skill in weapons, inſomuch that he commandeth that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

               <note place="margin">A quarrell is oftentimes begun without diſcretion.</note>For a ſmall or a bad quarrell hath many times ill ſucceſſe, therefore let thy quarrell be grounded vpon a good foundation, for then it halfe defendeth it ſelfe, but if it be vpon drinke or in defence of a lewd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſuch quarrells are naught, and haue ill ſucceſſe; againe haue this care, neuer be proud of thy skill, but goe as if thou hadſt it not, except occaſion ſerue: but be not lifted vp with a proud minde one ſtep the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for curteſie wins fauour with all men; wherefore all way ſo frame your ſpeech and anſwers, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer grow any quarrell vpon a fooliſh word or a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward anſwer.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, haue this skill in thy memory, ſo rule thy tongue as neuer to ſpeake ill, whether it bee true or falſe behind the backe of any man, for if the

Yet I doe aduiſe all men if vndiſcreet words doe paſſe from the mouth of the ſimple for lacke of wit (but I will not ſay for lacke of drinke) but whether it be drink or meer fooliſhneſſe, reuenge not euery wrong, but firſt conſider the worth and quality of the party which hath wronged thee, for if hee be a deſperate perſon, or one which hath nothing to looſe, nor wife nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to care for, ſome ſuch there are that are deſperat, and care not if they were out of the world,<note place="margin">Be valiant but not to ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> as our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſaith, hab or nab, fall backe fall edge, they care not whoſe houſe is on ſire, for they haue nothing to looſe, now although thou haſt the perfect skill with thy weapons, yet ſight not with ſuch raskalls, not with none vpon euery ſmall wrong; for ſo thou maiſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted careleſſe and bloody minded, as though <hi>Mars</hi> the God of battaile were thy father, or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelfe to bee more mighty then <hi>Hercules,</hi> or as one altogether forgetting that which ſo oft hath been ſeen, that a little wretch of ſtature by skill, iudgement, and reaſon,<note place="margin">As that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came great <hi>Gollas.</hi>

            <p>But I ſay there is great ods betwixt fighting in the field and playing in a fence-ſchoole, for in the field being both ſober, I meane if it be in a morning vpon cold blood, then euery man will as much feare to kill as to be killed, againe a man ſhall ſee to defend either blow or thruſt in the field then in a fence-ſchoole, for a man will be more bold with a foile or a cudgell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſmall danger in either of them.</p>
            <p>But when they come to tell their tale at the point of a rapier, they will ſtand off for their owne ſafety; go not into the field in the afternoone, partly for the

            <p>There is ſeldome or neuer any quarrell begun but in an afternoone, for then commonly the drinke is in and the wit is out, although thou knoweſt thy ſelfe in good caſe, and not to haue receiued more drinke then to ſuffice thy want, yet doſt thou not know how little drinke will ouercome the wits of another man; and this I know, and by good experience I ſpeake it, there is no ods during the time betwixt a madde man and a drunkard.</p>
            <p>Neuer ieſt with edge tooles, nor play not the foole with thy weapons, but keepe them to defend thy ſelfe when occaſion ſhall require thee, or at ſuch time as thou ſhalt be oppreſſed, for many hurts and much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe hath been done by ouer-much folly in ieſting with weapons, when at the beginning there was no harme meant.</p>

            <p>Therefore I hold it very vnfortunate to perſwade any man too too earneſtly, to goe into the field to fight againſt his will; neither goe into the field with euery raſcall, for thou doſt hazard thy ſelfe, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt no credite, wherefore, if ſuch a one do challenge thee, if thou canſt conueniently, breake his pate, for he is worthy of ſomewhat for his forwardnes, but to anſwer him otherwiſe, let this excuſe priuilege thee; ſay thou ſcorneſt to doe him that credite. Let thy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier be of a reaſonable length, rather too long then too ſhort, foure foote at the leaſt, except thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doe giue or ſend thee the length of his weapon; then it is a point of manhoode to match him as neare as thou canſt: alwayes let thine enemy tell his tale at the point of thy weapon; but truſt him not to whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with thee, leſt hee ſhall ſtabbe thee, or elſe by ſtrength recouer thy owne weapon, and ſo doe thee a miſchiefe before thou be aware; keepe cleane thy

But I ſay, thoſe that will go to Heauen, muſt not looke to be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a feather-bed, but by enduring iniuries, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, vexations, and tribulations: O then thinke on Heauen, and yet forget not Hell, preſume not, nor yet deſpaire not; liue to die, and yet die to liue: Oh then leade thy life in true humilitie, for ſo ſhalt thou vndoubtedly eſcape Hels damnation, and enioy Heauens euerlaſting ſaluation; which place the God of gods vouchſafe vs all.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S men of all arts trades and ſciences, differ in arte and workmanſhip, (as for example) all Phyſitions doe not vſe one kind of purgation, nor all Surgions one manner of ſalue, nor al writers write not alike, but to make a rehearſall of all artes it were too long, my meaning is ſo many men ſo many mindes, euen ſo in this art of defence as the number which are experienced in it is infinite, euen ſo ſeuerall faſhions doe exceede the number of infinite, if it were poſſible; for euery man holdeth his opinion to be beſt in that faſhion which he hath been moſt vſed vnto; although a man ſhew them many errours by good iudgement, yet it is as hard to withdraw them from their owne wil as it is to compell a Papiſt from his religion, which he hath been alwayes trained vp vnto.</p>
            <p>But the true skil of weapons once perfectly learned is neuer forgotten againe, for if any man were to fight for his life, as by a familiar example I will tell you of thoſe which haue been vnskilfull, yet haue had a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine occaſion to vſe their weapons, and euen then ſuddenly ſummoning vp their wits, what defence they ſhould vſe for the ſafegard of their liues, being ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly charged, doth not hee then as I ſaid remember himſelfe of the beſt defence, or the beſt trick, that euer was ſhewed him, for then is the time to ſtand him in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1116:24"/>ſtead, and then will vſe it, although he neuer plaid nor neuer practiſed in ſeauen yeeres before.</p>
            <p>Nay further, he which neuer learned one tricke but what nature beſtowed, nor neuer had any other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience vſe nor practiſe at one weapon nor other, but onely what he hath ſeene of others, by chance, where hee hath hapned to come: yet ſuch a one vpon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion being vrged thereunto, will inſtantly cal to minde that ſuch a time and ſuch a time, I did ſee ſuch a man fight or play, and he was accounted a very good player, or a very tall man of his hands, and thus he lay or thus he defended himſelfe; Loe thus imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for their defence that which they haue ſeene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe before, another example which by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I can ſpeake of, and that is of ſome which neuer did nor neuer could ſwim in all their liues, yet ſuch at ſometimes haue been in danger of drowning, by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce falling ouer boord into the ſea, or into other deepe Riuers, where there was no hope of life but onely by ſwimming, ſuch I ſay being put to their ſhifts, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred themſelues in the water, and ſo by laboring themſelues I meane with their hands and their feet, ſo haue eſcaped and ſaued their liues. Now I ſay if euery man before hand were grounded in skill with his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, &amp; in the art of ſwimming when they were yong, then would either of them be the leſſe fearefull, for what is bred in the bone, will neuer out of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Yet here one example more; take a yong plant, and ſet him, and come againe within a month, and you may pull him vp with eaſe, but let him grow a yeere or two and he will be ſo deepe rooted in the ground, ſo that you cannot pull him vp for your heart, except you vſe other meanes; euen ſo of youth, if they giue their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1116:25"/>minds to good and laudable exerciſes when they are yong, it were great pitty that they ſhold want encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, whereby it might take roote; but if their minds be giuen to any idle or bad exerciſes, it were good then that it were pulled vp in time, before it haue taken any deep root. And ſo I will here leaue off, becauſe I ſhall haue occaſion hereafter to ſpeake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe matters.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Fearefull examples of murther, with aduiſe to auoid murther.</head>
            <p>GEnerally three ſorts of men are hated for the moſt part, and very much abhorred, that is to ſay, the proud minded man, a coward, and a murtherer, but eſpecially a murtherer, howſoeuer it be done: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt vnhappy is he which killeth a man coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a deſperate humour, but if he doe it in his owne defence, or in a morning vpon a iuſt quarrell in the field, and both being equally matched, then it may be the better tollerated both before God and man, yet I doe not well to ſay ſo, for <hi>Romans</hi> the 9. it is ſaid, <hi>what art thou which doeſt diſpute with God,</hi> then why goe I about to make my toleration in murther, when God hath giuen vs an expreſſe commandement to the contrary, ſaying; <hi>thou ſhalt not kill. Exodus</hi> 20. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this ſaying,<note place="margin">In no caſe commit not murther.</note> he which ſtriketh with the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword, and likewiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> giueth vs a good leſſon ſaving, <hi>doe nothing without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and iudgement.</hi> Becauſe I touch diuinity in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of my booke, no doubt ſome will ſay what ſhould fencers meddle with diuinity; but to anſwer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1116:25"/>you againe, euery Chriſtian ought to know the word, (indeed the ſword is good) but much the better when they goe both together. But to our matter againe: thoſe which feare God, and by chance happen into the company of a murtherer, there haire will ſtare, and their blood will riſe, that they will inwardly wiſh they were out of his company againe, for many ſimple men do feare a murtherer euer after they haue once known him to commit a murther, yet diuers honeſt men doe by chance happen into a murtherers company, when they would bee glad to ſhift themſelues from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; or as were to ſpue him out of their preſence, in regard of his euill qualities, which is quarrelling, and taking exceptions vpon any little occaſion. If any man alſo doe ſeeme to contrary a murtherer, or a litle croſſe him in his ſwaggering, he will forthwith breake out into theſe or ſuch like vngodly ſpeeches, ſaying; I haue killed a far better man than thy ſelfe; ſuch like words will he ſay with a brazen face, and a ſtony heart, lifted vp with the pride of his manhood: for he that is a murtherer doth thinke that he is the beſt man in the world, eſpecially if he eſcape the gallowes ſo long, vntill he hath killed two or three men: I haue been my ſelfe in company with many of them,<note place="margin">Oh remember how the curſe of God fell vpon <hi>Cain</hi> for murther.</note> but I did neuer ſee any fruit of repentance in them; for when they haue paſt the hands of the pittifull Iudge, then they thinke that they are cleered for euer, as well in this world as in the world to come; and then will they ſay if they did offend, they had the Law for it; but I know not how ſo many of them eſcape the gallowes: there is a Prouerbe ſaith, <hi>fooliſh pitty ouerthroweth towne and Citty.</hi> I thinke and am verily perſwaded, that a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is accurſt and hated both of God and man, yea I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1116:26"/>am alſo perſwaded that the houſe is accurſt wherein they dwell, and the ſhip wherein they ſaile at ſea, mark their end, and you ſhall ſee that although they paſſe the hands of men, yet God perſues them with the hue and crye of his vengeance, which followeth them, and apprehendeth them, and bringeth ſome of them to one kind of death, and ſome to another; as theſe few examples following ſhal declare, and thou maiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of them to thy benefit.</p>
            <p>Firſt Sir <hi>Iohn Fitz:</hi> how wickedly and how cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly did bewith two or three of his men purſue and ouertake Maſter <hi>Stannell,</hi> as he was riding from <hi>Testok</hi> in <hi>Deuonſhire,</hi> towards his owne houſe, this Maſter <hi>Stannell</hi> was beloued both of rich and poore, hee was a good and bountifull houſe-keeper, and his vntimely death was lamented of thouſands, the occaſion of the quarrell, was as I haue heard becauſe Maſter <hi>Stannell</hi> called Sir <hi>Iohn Fitz.</hi> Tenant, for that ſir <hi>Iohn Fitz</hi> his father hid vſed to pay him a matter of two ſhillings a yeere: this was no great cauſe of quarrel if it had been weighed in the ballance of diſcretion, conſidering the great loue and familiarity which had continued long time betwixt them, the which alſo was the reaſon that Maſter <hi>Stannell</hi> had not of long time demanded the rent, nor did make any reckoning or account of it. But then both hauing appointed to meet at a merry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Teſtok onely to be merry, and there this vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate word tenant proceeded out of Maſter <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels</hi> mouth, which ſit <hi>Iohn</hi> tooke in very great choller, Maſter <hi>Sannell</hi> perceiuing that hee had moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him betooke himſelfe preſently to his horſe, and riding homewards hauing but only his footman with him, before he had rode two miles, ſir <hi>Iohn Fitz</hi> with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1116:26"/>two or three of his men, being well horſt ouer-tooke Maſter <hi>Stannell</hi> and there compaſſing him about ſom before him and ſome behind him, moſt cowardly and deſperately murthered him; and vpon that ſir <hi>Iohn</hi> fled into <hi>France,</hi> but before one yeere was paſt his friends procured a pardon for him, inſomuch that he came home againe, and to euery mans ſeeming was at qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but the hue and cry of Gods vengeance was in his conſcience, and three or fowre yeeres after vpon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> way there apprehended him, as you ſhall heare; for then and there moſt cruelly and diueliſhly he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his hoſte, which was a very honeſt man, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moſt deſperately with his owne hands tooke his rapier and murthered himself; yet thus much I can ſay of ſir <hi>Iohn Fitz</hi> he was a proper man, and for the ſpace of thirty yeeres he liued orderly, to the geſſe of the world, for he was well beloued in his country, and if he had ſo continued to the end, it had been well, but what ſhould I ſay, a man may be an honeſt man thirty yeers, yea forty years, and yet be a knaue at the laſt.</p>
            <p>Another example was that of one <hi>Hocket</hi> of <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> who looking out at a window, and eſpying one Captaine <hi>Robinſon</hi> comming downe the ſtreet, and he hauing an old quarrell to the ſaid <hi>Robinſon</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at ſea, this <hi>Hocket</hi> ſtept to his dore with his rapier ready drawn, and ſtanding within his owne houſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Captaine <hi>Robinſon</hi> was come iuſt againſt his door, he there without ſpeaking one word ran him through with his rapier, and afterwards was cleered by the Iudge of this world, but after his comming out of the gayle, he went to ſea, Maſter in a man of war, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten dayes after he was gone from <hi>Plimoth</hi> to ſea, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1116:27"/>firſt ſhip they met withall ſhot but one ſhot, and yet killed this <hi>Hocket,</hi> and no man in the ſhip killed nor hurt but only this murtherer.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in <hi>Plimoth</hi> one Captaine <hi>Treherne</hi> and Captaine <hi>Egles</hi> fell out about nothing in a manner, the cauſe was for that one of them was denied lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where the other did lie by the good wife of the houſe, for it may bee ſhe affected the one better then the other, and two dogs and one bone commonly can neuer agree well together, but they fell out about ſuch a trifling matter, and at the doore in the ſtreete they fought, and in the firſt bout, <hi>Treherne</hi> was downe in the gutter, and <hi>Eagles</hi> there in preſence of many might haue killed him, but ſtaied his hand, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to riſe againe, but then <hi>Trehearne</hi> aſſaulted Captaine <hi>Eagles</hi> moſt furiouſly, and it ſo chanced that with a blow <hi>Eagles</hi> rapier brake, and then running into a houſe to ſaue himſelfe, <hi>Traherne</hi> run him into the backe and killed him, and afterwards he receiued his tryall for it, but by the mercy of the Iudge he was diſcharged of that matter. After his comming out of the gayle, he preſently got a crue of twenty eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and a ſhip, and went a rouing vpon the coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> where they were all taken, and euery man of them hanged in <hi>France,</hi> now I doe verily perſwade my ſelfe that many of them might haue been liuing at this day, if they had not hapned into this murtherers company.</p>
            <p>Alſo, one <hi>Bartlet,</hi> who appointed the field with an other, after one bout, his enemy requeſted him to holde his hands, that he might breathe, which hee conſented vnto; but as they both ſtoode ſtill, this <hi>Bartlet</hi> ſodainly charged his weapon vpon the other,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1116:27"/>and ranne him through, that he died preſently, and then <hi>Bartlet</hi> fled and eſcaped away for the ſpace of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares, but the huy and crie of Gods vengeance followed him, inſomuch, that hee came againe to Plimouth of his owne accord, thinking that all was well, and forgotten; but there he was apprehended, and after the law had had his courſe vpon him, Gods vengeance left him not, but broght him to Plimouth againe, and ſhortly after, another did challenge this <hi>Bartlet,</hi> they both mette in the field, and there was <hi>Bartlet</hi> killed, not farre from the place where he had killed the other before, and he that killed him, fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and is not taken as yet.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Remember this example.</note> to end theſe examples with the lamentableſt hiſtorie that euer penne did write, for a more cruell murther was neuer committed, of king <hi>Richard</hi> the third, in the Chronicles,<note place="margin">If this make not your eares tingle, yet it may make your heart; tremble.</note> there may you reade it more at large, that after hee had committed his brothers two children to the Tower, hee was not contented, but would haue the liues of theſe poore Infants, the doers of this helliſh and cruell murder, were ſir <hi>Iames Tirrell, Miles Forreſt,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dighton,</hi> theſe three laying their heads together, what manner of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were beſt to be vſed in that Tragedie,<note place="margin">Fearefull viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do haunt a murtherer.</note> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the end, to ſtifle them in their beds in the dead time of the night, and ſo with the cloathes and pillowes which were about them, theſe three murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers preſſing them downe vnder the cloaths (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) bereaued them quickely of their liues, now, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, what a helliſh horrour had this King in his conſcience, yea it ſo vexed and tormented his ſpirits, that he was neuer well nor at quiet ſleeping nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; for in the night hee would ſodainely ſtart out
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1116:28"/>of his bed, and goe vp and downe the Chamber like a madde man; likewiſe in the day he neuer thought himself ſure, but alwayes feared treaſons, his eies rowling continually about him, and oftentimes hee would clappe his hand vpon his dagger, when there was no need, and afterwards he was vanquiſhed with his enemies; and on the other three God ſhewed his vengeance ſomwhat in this world. For Sir <hi>Iames Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> was beheaded afterwards at the Tower for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not for that matter; and <hi>Miles Forreſt</hi> had a conſuming and a lingring life, for his fleſh did rotte away by peece-meale, and ſo miſerably died; <hi>Iohn Dighton</hi> liued in great hatred, and was abhorred and pointed at of all that knew him, and at the laſt died in great pouerty and miſery. But I referre you vnto the Chronicle, as aforeſaid, which declares it more at large: and ſo I will goe on a little further to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>Though the Law doe ſpare and not cut off a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer ſo ſoone as hee hath deſerued death; yet I ſay the horrour of his murthering conſcience will ſo bee gnawing at his bloudy heart, vntill it hath eaten and conſumed him to nothing; alſo the horrible paines of hell will by viſions ſhew, and ſo plainely appeare vnto him, ſtill ſounding in his eares ſuch a peale, that hee many times will thinke that the diuell is come from hell; for ſo long as hee liueth, his ſpirits will be ſo diſtempered and affrighted, that in the night, many times ſeuerall viſions will appeare, ſometimes ſpirits with vgly ſhapes, and ſometimes a multitude of weaponed Officers ruſſeling in to apprehend him, and ſometimes the ghoſt of him which was murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, inſomuch that many times hee will ſweate for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1116:28"/>feare, with running, labouring, and ſtriuing to keepe himſelfe out of their gripe, and in a word, afraide he will be (in a maner) of euery graſſe; and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was accounted for a merrie companion, is now ouercome with wilde lookes and melancholie thoughts, taking no ioy, in wealth, wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Loe, this is a life, but it is as weariſome as hell vntill death doth catch him, for death waiteth vpon a murtherer as a halter doth vpon the ſtealer; as for example of ſir <hi>Iohn Gilbert</hi> euer after the killing of ſir <hi>Iohn Burrowes,</hi> of which the world ſaith it was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable quarrell, and yet in the night his friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that he would ſodainely ſtart out of his bed, being ſore affrighted, he knew not at what, he liued not many yeares after, but yet died in his bedde; ſo likewiſe maſter <hi>Hely</hi> killed captaine <hi>Foſcue</hi> vpon a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine quarrel, meeting in the ſtreete in Plimmouth, yet, by the courſe of the Lawe, was acquitted for it; but afterwards, ſo long as hee liued, hee liued a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented life, and was neuer well in his conſcience vntill death tooke him. Now all theſe were but yong men, and in the middeſt of their yeares, to the eye of the world, either of them might haue liued many yeares longer, and yet not haue beene accounted for olde men.</p>
            <p>I could ſpend much paper and time with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of examples touching this matter, but I will here conclude, and leaue the reſt to thy daily experience, which thine eares may heare, and thine eies daily ſee (almoſt in euery place) farre more fearfull examples, concerning this former matter, the more is the pitty; but what becommeth of them after this life is ended may ſeeme doubtfull, but I leaue that to the ſecret
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1116:29"/>wiſedome and power of Almightie God; but there is no queſtion to be made of thoſe which leade a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly life, but they ſhall haue a wicked and an vngodly end; as on the contrary ſide, thoſe that leade a godly and an vpright life, ſhall make a good and godly end: for if a man doe well, he ſhall haue well, but if he doe ill, he ſhall haue ill. More concerning this matter you may reade towardes the end of the eight chapter following.</p>
            <p>But I thinke it not amiſſe, heere in this place, to ſhew you alitle concerning murthers done in ſecret; for as the Prouerb goeth; Murther will not be hidde; albeit for a time God doth ſuffer a murtherer to liue and reigne without apprehenſion, yet in the end he makes the diuell bring foorth his ſeruant, to receiue his wages with ſhame enough, a murther can not be kept ſtill cloſe: for the Lord ſometimes doth bring a murther to light that hath beene done in ſecret, by the birds of the aire, by water, by fire, by dogges, as in briefe by theſe examples ſhal plainly be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
            <p>It hath beene knowne that a murthered carkaſſe hath beene throwne into the Sea when it was flowed to the full, thereby thinking, that with the ebbe he would haue beene carried away, but the water being gone, the murthered carkaſſe was found where it was firſt throwne in.</p>
            <p>Alſo, I knew a woman that was arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for murthering her childe, and well ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the ſame; for ſhee cutte the childe into ſmall peeces, and then ſhe tooke and threw them vnder a hote furnace where ſhe was a brewing: but when ſhe had done brewing, and the fire out, there was found
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1116:29"/>the peeces of the childe in the aſhes, ſo freſh (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) as it was throwne in.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, in Worceſterſhire were two brothers, the one a very honeſt man, and by his honeſt means I and good induſtry, had gotten to himſelfe a pretty houſe, and crownes in his purſe. But his brother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a careleſſ vnthrift, and enuying at his brothers proſperous eſtate, yet kept he it to himſelfe, vntill fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding opportunitie, one night (but they two being in the houſe together;) this graceleſſe vnthrift forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with knockt his brother on the head, which when hee had done, hee cutte off his legges, and buryed him vnder the harth in the chimney, and layd the ſtones againe very artificially, hoping then that all the goodes were his owne; and when the neighbors enquired of him for his brother, he tolde them that hee was gone a iourney farre off, to viſite ſome of his friends. But (a ſhort tale to make) this murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer made a feaſt, and inuited his neighbours and his friends; and when they were all aſſembled together within the houſe, as they ſate by the fire ſide, they perceiued the ſtones in the chimney to riſe, and the fire tumbled downe out of the chimney, for the heat of the fire made the dead carkaſſe ſwell: and then ſearch being made, the carkaſſe was found, and the murtherer taken and executed. God I beſeech him bleſſe euery good man from murther, and from being murthered.</p>
            <p>I haue knowne many times, that ſome (through ignorance) haue committed murther, in parting of a fray, I meane ſuch as are not experimented in the Lawe, nor haue no reaſon in ſuch a caſe; for many times they which ſhould keep the peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1116:30"/>murther ignorantly, I meane, in comming in, either with club or halberd, or ſuch like weapon, and comming behind one of the two that are in fight, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him on the head, when hee little expecteth any hurt of any other, but from him which hee is now in hand withall, when indeed in ſuch a caſe, they ought to ſtrike downe the weapons of thoſe which are figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or breaking them, but not ſtrike them. Whoſe mindes are occupied with fury one againſt the other, and little expecting a miſchiefe to come from one which they neuer offended. Againe ſome in parting of a fray will run in betwixt them, and hold his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend, and leaue the other at liberty, and by this meanes he which hath been at liberty hath killed him which is ſo holden, when many times it had not ſo fallen out, if they had been both let alone to ſhift for themſelues, therefore men ought to haue experience and to vſe diſcretion in the parting of a fray, for fools do neuer fore-caſt of a miſchiefe before hand, but wiſe men preuent it before it falls.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I would wiſh whatſoeuer thou bee, which readeſt this leſſon, to remember it, and regard the life of a man, although many are at ſome times ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnruly, yet let no abuſe cauſe thee to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither in thy owne quarrell, nor in parting of any other: for I haue heard and knowne many times that a ſmall ſtroke hath been giuen with no intention of murther, yet it hath fallen out to the contrary, yea and contrary vnto all mens expectation, which haue ſeen that a man with his fiſt or with a riding rodde, or with a penny loafe, and other things of leſſe danger, and yet ſome haue dyed being ſtrucken therewithal.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any will ſay that skill in weapons is a good thing, and fit to be learned of euery man, yet all men will ſay it is pitty that a man without gouernment ſhould know the ſecret skill in weapons, for indeede skil doth moſt chiefly of all belong to a man that hath wit and diſcretion to gouern it, that when he hath skill knoweth how to vſe it as it ought to bee vſed, for a good thing learned and abuſed were better refuſed and neuer learned: for ſome when they haue a little more skill then euery common man, then will they thinke by brauing euery man which commeth in their company, by ſwaggering it with proud brags and high lookes, yet I haue known ſuch ſwaggering compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which haue had more haire then wit, meete with their match and carry away the blowes with diſgrace, and yet themſelues beginners of the quarrell when they might haue liued quiet if they would.</p>
            <p>Therefore he which weareth the greateſt whiſtle is not the beſt Mariner, nor he the beſt man that maketh the greateſt brags, for ſome will braue a better man then themſelues, and ſwagger it out, and yet ſo little in themſelues that they will ſcarce hold the touching when they come to the ſtone to bee tryed, yet euery ſubiect ought if occaſion ſerue to fight for his King and country, if it be for the Goſpells ſake, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in defence of their owne reputation and credit.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1116:31"/>
            <p> Now although this art of defence is ſo fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a thing for all men to be learned, yet withall I doe exhort and earneſtly intreat all ſuch as haue skill to vſe it in that faſhion as it ought to be vſed, for if a man had twenty good qualities &amp; yet if he be a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, that one ill quality ouerthroweth all the reſt, like as when a Cow giueth a good ſope of milke, and then afterwards ſtriketh it downe with her foote: ſhe is as much to bee blamed for the loſſe, as commended for the gift, euen ſo a man without gouernment groweth out of fauour both with God &amp; man, for many a man without diſcretion and iudgement many times doth fall out with his familiar friend, and ſo dare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the field, preſently vpon the ſuddaine falling out. Now if wit be in neither of them, then a thouſand to one but murther is committed, for a man with skill may better fight with a hundred in the morning one after another, then with three in an afternoone, vpon drinke or hot blood; for if you forbeare to kill thou maiſt be killed thy ſelfe, if thou take thy opportunity thou maiſt eaſily kill a drunkard in his owne comming in, for he will come in without feare or wit: for drinke maketh a very coward challenge the beſt man liuing, for in drinke I haue knowen many paſſe their words to meete in the field vpon ſmall occaſion, if with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion the quartell were rightly conſidered vpon; but their owne ſelues in the morning when they haue their right wits about them, then do they many times repent, and wiſh the match were to make, and that their words were vnſpoken which they ſpake the night before. Yet neuertheleſſe when a man hath paſſed his word howſoeuer things fall out, hee muſt and will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1116:31"/>the challenge, yea though he looſe his life by it. Loe theſe are the fruits of drunkenneſſe, al other vices may be left, but no bridle will rule a drunkard, nor no counſell will make him forgoe his draunken and ſwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh life, drunkenneſſe is the mother of all vices, for drunkenneſſe doth beget and breede all manner of deadly ſins, for by inordinate drinking thy ſoule is endangered, thy body is infected, thy vnderſtanding baniſhed, thy manhood diſtaſted, thy ſubſtance wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and beaſtlyneſſe reſembled, and thy buſineſſe neglected, therefore leaue that one vice, and all other will flie away with it: for as I ſaid before it is the only breeder and maintainer of quarrelling and fighting, by fighting God is diſpleaſed, and the Kings Lawes broken; againe if murther be committed, thou looſeſt thy goods, and endangereſt thy life; if thou looſe it not, yet thou ſhalt liue deſpiſed, &amp; hard of all honeſt minds that knowes thee, ſo that thy life will be more loathſome then death, therefore not to fight at all is beſt, except thou be charged vpon contrary to thy expectation, then defend thy ſelfe, and yet feare as much to kill as to be killed.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1116:32"/>out for the value of a ruſh, and ſuch and ſuch haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one another for iuſt nothing, is not heere more madneſſe?<note place="margin">Be wel aduiſed before thou do paſſe thy word, for a man will be as good as his word, for a man will be as good as his word, if it do coſt him his life: for it is a cowards tricke to crie <hi>peccaui,</hi> or leaſt in ſight the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> yet I will not ſay but at one time or another a mans reputation may be ſo neerly touched, that it cannot ſtand with his credit to pocket it vp, although it be made vpon drinke, for indeed the pot is the chief cauſe almoſt of all quarrells, yet being wronged, it can not ſtand with a mans credite, to keepe his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in his ſheathe; neyther doe I counſell all men to pocket vp all iniuries which ſome will proffer them, but to anſwer a good quarrell, not onely with words but with deeds, as followeth, for the further inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Whoſo is honourably challenged vnto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle combate, the challenged may make choice of his weapon, and likewiſe of the time when, and of the place where.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, the challenged may chooſe to fight on foote or on horſe backe, which for his beſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage hee ſhall thinke fitteſt: now alſo the challenged is to conſider well the qualitie of the Challenger, that thereby hee may make the better prouiſion of ſuch furniture as may ſerue for his owne defence, and likewiſe to terrifie and hurt the challenger.</p>
            <p>Now, if the challenger be chollericke and haſtie, then charge thy poynt directly vpon him, that if hee preaſe vpon thee, he may come vpon his own death: but before thou goeſt into the field, diſcharge thy duty and conſcience towards God, aſwell as in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, for thy beſt aduantage, otherwiſe it can not chooſe but be to thy body dangerous, and vnto thy ſoule doubtfull, and a moſt principall note is this to be obſerued, for thou art not ſure whether euer thou ſhalt returne againe or neuer.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1116:32"/>
            <p> Remember your skill, when you are at play, or in fight, for I haue knowne many, when their fight and play is ended, they doe remember, that with this tricke, or with that tricke they might haue defended themſelues, and either hurt or diſgraced their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but many (through madneſſe and fury) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it not till it be too late.</p>
            <p>If you be both skilfull in the falſe play, then I hold it good for both to play vpon the true play, for it booteth but little to vſe falſe play to one that knowes how to proffer it, and how to defend it; for it is ill halting before a Cripple, yet I will not ſay but the beſt of all may be deceiued by falſe play, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe play may ſtand thee in great ſtead, vpon thoſe which are not come vnto the ful perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Againe, one may haue skil in one kind of falſe play, but not in all.</p>
            <p>Now whether thy enemy be skilfull or not, it is a very eaſie matter to know ſo ſoone as hee beginneth to charge his weapon, if thou haddeſt no former knowledge before hand. If two crafty knaues meete at dice, if either of them ſhift in falſe dice, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will perceiue it preſently, and ſo they will know each other to be gameſters, but they will giue ouer the ſooner, with ſmall loſſe each to other, referring themſelues to their better fortunes, and hoping to meete with eaſier gameſters; euen ſo I wiſh all men, if they perceiue themſelues to be hardly matched, the wiſer of them to yeelde vpon compoſition, after rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable triall made each one of the other, before any great hurt be done; for the beſt man that euer brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, hath, and may meete with his equall: and when two good men meete, the conqueſt will be hardly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1116:33"/>and dangerouſly ended on the one ſide, except Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion be a mediator to take vp the matter, before it come to the worſt, if by friends it be not ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand; but if thou canſt hurt thy enemy, yes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be but a little, or vnarme him of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, which thou mayeſt very eaſily doe, if thou doe fight with good diſcretion. And eyther of theſe are accounted for a victorie; alſo, take this for a generall rule alwayes, keepe thy bodie within compaſſe of true Defence, conſidering otherwiſe, that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is great in that part of the bodie which lieth moſt diſcouered, and is neareſt vnto thine enemie.</p>
            <p>Now when thy enemy doth aſſault thee, and is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp his weapon to diſcharge at thee, be not then to prepare thy Defence, but be ready before hand to defend euery part of thy bodie, according to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, as when you come to it you ſhall ſee more plainely. For thou doſt not know before hand where the blow will light: As ſhrinking vp of ſhoulders is no payment of debts, no more will winking or blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king defend thy carkaſſe, as thoſe which haue no skil will winke: therefore, againe, and againe, I ſay, bee prepared with skill before hand. Moſt ſure it is the blow muſt haue his fall: but at euery weapon I haue ſhewed how to defend it, therefore the Defender muſt bee well experienced before hand with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, at ſuch a weapon as he meaneth vſually to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that when the blow doth light, thou mayeſt bee in thy defence, not to defend thine enemies blowe onely, but alſo to anſwere him againe in the time of aduantage, for a quicke anſwer ſheweth good cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Nor to know the true place for the holding of of thy weapon, that is not all, but alwayes ſo long
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1116:33"/>as thou art within thy enimies danger continue them in their place, except it be at the very inſtant time when thou goeſt about to offend thine enemy, and that muſt be done with a very good diſcretion, and thy weapon muſt bee recouered vp againe into his place nimbly. Now if thy enemy doe diſcouer ſome part of his body, that, to thy ſeeming, lieth very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, yet be not too haſtie in offering play, though the baite be neuer ſo faire, bite not at it too raſhly or vnaduiſedly, leſt like the fooliſh Fiſh you be taken with the hooke which lieth couered with the baite; for if your enemy finde your weapon or weapons out of the place of true defence, yea if it be but an inch too high, or too lowe, too wide, or too narrow, it is aſmuch as concerneth thy life: if thou be matched with one that is skilfull, neuer ouerlay thy ſelfe with a heauy weapon, for nimbleneſſe of bodie, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſse of weapon are two chiefe helpes for thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage in play. Againe, and againe I ſay, ſtrike not one blow in fight, at what weapon ſoeuer thou fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt withall, except it be a wriſt blowe, and that you may aſwell doe with a rapier, as with a ſword, for a wriſt blow conſumeth but a little time, yet better vſe no blowe at all, but continually, thruſt after thruſt: for (in my minde) hee is a man ignorant and very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnskilfull that will bee hurt with a blow, and if thou make an aſſault vpon thy enemy doe not tarry by it, to maintaine it, for in making the aſſault diſtance is broken, wherefore recouer backe into your guard and diſtance againe ſo ſoone as you can, and alwayes let your ees be on your enemies face, and not altogether on the point, then you may be deceiued, by the ſwift motion of the hand, for the motion of the hand is ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1116:34"/>then the eye or foot, many will ſet their eyes vpon their enemies point, or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hand for the auoiding of this error, the beſt remedy is daily exerciſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe one with another, and to play with more then one, otherwiſe thou wilt neuer come vnto true defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for it is good to be acquainted with euery mans faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that tricke which will hit one will not hit ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore be well experienced not onely in the true play but in the falſe; I meane for the defence and offence of both, that if thou canſt not preuaile with the one then vſe the other: yet take heed of haſty aduenturing in, leaſt thou with the fooliſh bird which flyeth into the lime buſh, and being in, the more ſhe ſtriueth, the faſter ſhe is; then make no more haſt then good ſpeed, leaſt thou be taken in thy owne folly, for many times haſte maketh waſte: if thou ſhooteſt at a marke if the marke be neuer ſo faire, yet if thou ſhoot haſtily without diſcretion, thou maiſt oftner miſſe then hit; alſo I doe aduiſe thee not to determine to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer euery thruſt or blow home which thy enemy doth aſſault thee with; but to anſwer it ſomthing ſhort vntill thou perceiue whether he haue any falſe play or not, otherwiſe if thou make thy anſwer home, he may deceiue thee by falſe play: now if both be experienced in the true play and falſe then you might continue in fight a whole day, if it were poſſible to endure ſo long and haue no hurt: if thou haue a cloſe hilted dagger and a rapier, I hold them more ſurer then a ſword and dagger, but with the skilfull there is no danger in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; againe in fight a man need not vſe halfe the skil which he may learne, the ſecond point of haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is to holde faſt, and the ſecond and chiefeſt point in this exerciſe is to learne to defend thy ſelfe, and to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1116:34"/>vſe it when thou haſt occaſion, then remember where about thou art.</p>
            <p>And let no illuſions cauſe thee to looke about thee when thou art within thy enemies diſtance, leaſt hee take the aduantage when thou doſt not ſee him, or before thou be aware, as many doe: for after when thou haſt the wound, it is but a folly for thee to ſay, I had thought he would not haue ſtrucken me ſo cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly: I remember a tale as I heard out of <hi>Germany,</hi> thus it was, the Maſter and vſher of a ſchool had vpon occaſion appointed the field, and their weapon was each of them a two handed ſword, and meeting at the place appointed, ſaid the Maſter thou art not ſo good as thy word, the Vſher asked him why; marry ſaid he thou promiſeſt to bring no body with thee, and yet looke yonder what a number of people are comming towards thee, the vſher no ſooner looked about, but the Maſter ſmote off his head, and afterwards meeting with ſome of his friends ſaid, I haue taught my man a new tricke this morning ſaid he, which he neuer lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before. Loe thus he killed him by policy, but it it was no manly tricke, neither doe I commend this manner of murther: in my mind the Maſter had been better that he had denied to goe into the field with his man, then to haue ſuch a clog of murther vpon his conſcience by killing of him, by what meanes or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy ſoeuer; for euery one ought to remember that he muſt not take vengeance, when and where he may, ſo oft as an inury is profered him, concerning this there is a good example to bee imitated by ſtrong beaſts which neuer turne againe when little curs runne bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after them, for the mighty or skilfull ought to vſe their power moderately, for ſo they may the better vſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1116:35"/>continually, for although fighting be the triall of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and skill in weapons, and many men thereby prooue their force, and yet afterwards become great frinds, for fighting is nothing dangerous being both wary and skilfull: but now in my mind much deceiued are thoſe which thinke that a quarrell begunne with words cannot he ended but with weapons, but my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is that ſo long as no blowes paſſe but onely words, yet words are the cauſe of many quarrells, for words will ſting worſe then a nettle, and pricke deeper then a thorne, and cut more keener then a ſword, yet for all that let wiſedome and reaſon guide thy hand and after you haue croſſe one another with two or three croſſe words, then fall into a ciuill kind of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the matter, and not in fury ſuffering it to grow into any further quarrell, for a little ſparke at the firſt is eaſily quenched, euen ſo vpon the drinking of a cup of wine or a pipe of Tobacco, or vpon ſuch a light matter of no importance many a quarrell is begun; now in ſuch a caſe I would wiſh the wiſer of the two in his good diſcretion, to yeeld firſt, and ſo to end it without further grudging, for reaſonable ſpeeches may be a full ſatisfaction where a ſmall offence is committed.</p>
            <p>But now if one of the parties in a ſtubborne frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardneſſe will not yeeld but rather goe into the field with a deſire to kill the other, now if there be neuer a one of them wiſe, murther is committed and at leiſure repented: but he which firſt beginneth the quarrell, or giueth the firſt box on the eare, raſhly or vnaduiſedly, vpon a ſmall matter as aforeſaid, is worthy and well deſerueth to be anſwered againe with three, or elſe with the baſtinado. And to match with this I will tell
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1116:35"/>you a tale of a Frier, who in his ſermon ſaid if one giue thee a blow on the one eare, turne the other and take another, and a luſty ſeruingman hearing him, after the ſermon was ended, hee came vnto the Frier and ſaid, ſir you made a good Sermon, but yet in my mind there was ſmall reaſon in one leſſon that you gaue vs, what was that ſaid the Frier, marry quoth the ſeruing-man that if one giue me a blow on the eare, I ſhould turne the other, and take another: why ſaith the frier the Scripture commaundeth vs ſo to doe, but quoth the ſeruing man will you follow the ſcripture herein, yes marry that I will ſaid the Frier, with that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing-man vp with his fiſt and gaue him a good boxe on the eare; the frier turned the other, and tooke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but now ſaith the Scripture (quoth the Frier) looke what you would haue others do to you, doe the like to them; looke what meaſure you meate, the like meaſure ſhall be meaſured to you againe, with heape and thruſt, and running ouer, and with that the Frier tooke a good crab-tree cudgell and beat the ſeruing-man well fauouredly, and ſo to our former matter againe. Doth euery blow that is giuen deſerue the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering in the field, I ſay not but firſt requite the blow againe, as before ſaid, for I haue valued the rate of the firſt beginner ſo low as may be, for he is worthy to be requited, not in the ſame manner, but in a more open faſhion, requite the boxe againe, and then being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled of the firſt wrong; let him which beganne the game reckon of his penny-worths, and if in caſting vp his reckoning hee finde himſelfe a looſer, let him ſit downe by his loſſe, and learne to make a wiſer bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine an other time; but if it cannot be ſo ended, then it muſt be anſwered otherwiſe as occaſion ſhall ſerue.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1116:36"/>
            <p> Now if the lie be giuen before you grow into chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with a raſh fooliſh fellow; firſt, conſider in what caſe the party is, which giueth the lie, before thou ſtrike; for in drinke or in furie I haue ſeene one giue the lie, which would not haue done it at an other time, I meane when hee had his right wittes about him. Well, but ſay a man, at ſuch time, and in ſuch a caſe, doe giue the lie, ſome mad heads will ſay, that it deſerueth the ſtabbe preſently;<note place="margin">Therefore doe not that to day which may bee repented of to morrow.</note> but I neuer knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſtabbe or kill another, vpon what occaſion ſoeuer, but he was ſorie for it afterwards:That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner is not to be commended which getteth his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by many ſhip-wreckes; nor that man is not to be praiſed for his gouernement which getteth it by his puniſhment, which he hath for the killing of two or three men.</p>
            <p>Now, vpon the receiuing the lie, if the ſtabbe be not giuen, ſome giddie headed kill-calues will ſay, that ſuch a man tooke the lie, and did not anſwere it with a ſtabbe, wherefore hee is a coward; but now I ſay, and this is my opinion, he ſheweth the beſt wit, and moſt valour, which ſeeing a man out of the way, (as we terme it) will giue a milde and a quiet anſwere vnto a froward queſtion: alſo the wiſer ſort will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the patience of him that can beare with one that is paſt reaſon; for all men know, that hee which committeth murther, will afterwards wiſh with bitter reares, that hee had conquered his affections, and ſtayed his handes, I meane, if there be any ſparke of grace at all in him; and the firſt which ſtriketh, many times looſeth his life, therefore though thou cannot rule thy tongue, yet haue a care to rule thy hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a miſchiefe be done, for hee which committeth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1116:36"/>murther, when hee commeth to examination, it is but a ſimple excuſe to ſay, The other gaue mee the lie, and called me knaue, and I could not brooke it. There is a prety example, and worth the noting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch a matter (as I haue heard it) and thus it was. A Iudge ſitting in iudgement againſt a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who anſwered for himſelfe ſaying, and it pleaſe you my Lord, hee gaue mee the lie, and called mee knaue. Why ſaid the Iudge, wilt thou kill a man for that? call me knaue, and giue me the lie: the Iudge being importunate, in the end, the murtherer ſaid, You are a knaue, and you do lie; then the Iudge tooke the skirt of his coate and ſhooke it, and ſaid, Lord, now what am I the worſe? but euerie man can not be ſo patient: although ſome will keepe company ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares, and yet neuer giue any cauſe of quarrell: yet ſome againe will vpon a little drinke, or vpon a ſmall occaſion quarrell, ſwagger and fight almoſt in euerie company they come into; there is a Prouerbe goeth, He which hath an ill name, is halfe hanged: Before he commeth to the Barie, another Prouerbe touching our former matter ſaith, Hee which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for an earely riſer, may lie a bed till eleauen of the clocke: euen ſo hee which hath tried his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, afterwards the world will iudge and ſay, that he is a man of his hands, and that he dare fight vpon a good occaſion; but if he make a common occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fighting, hee will then bee accounted for a common quarreller, and his friends will refuſe his company many times for doubt of his quarrelling, and yet hee ſhall neuer be accounted, more then a man againe. Hee which is quarrelſome ſhall often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meete with his match; but if a tried fellow doe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1116:37"/>at ſometimes forbeare when hee is wronged or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, the wiſer ſort will neuer account the worſe manhoode in him; therefore except it be vpon a moſt open and great abuſe, let Patience be thy buckler, and a faire tongue thy ſword, and alwayes haue a care in the beginning what wilbe the end; for a miſchiefe ſometimes happeneth in an houre which happeneth not in ſeauen yeares againe, but Oh thrice happie were that man, which towards the latter end of his dayes, can without a paire of lying lips ſay, I thanke my God, I neuer bare malice, nor I neuer iniuriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly wronged any man, in thought, word, or deed in all my life.</p>

            <p>And if a man write well, and exerciſe it neuer ſo much, yet hee can neuer exceed, well written; euen ſo in skill of weapons a man may be perfect, and play well; but when thou haſt learned the true and perfect skill with thy weapons, thou maiſt exerciſe for thine health and recreation, but thou ſhalt neuer paſſe that word, well plaid.</p>
            <p>Alſo, he which writeth much, and doth not regard
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1116:38"/>his coppie, but writeth after his owne will, I thinke it were ſtrange for ſuch a Scholler to write well, but he will alwaies write a ragged hand: euen ſo hee that getteth him hilts and cudgells, and goeth about to learne of his owne head without direction of one that is skilfull, it were better that he had neuer play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if afterwards he goe to learne; for he muſt firſt vnlearne that which he hath learned, which will bee very hard to be done without great paines taking.</p>
            <p>Now he which writeth a good Secretarie hand, and then afterwards he goeth to learne Roman hand, or Court hand, or any other the like, hee doth not thereby looſe his Secretary; but if hee can write all kinde of hands, then may he vſe moſt, that which hee liketh beſt, or thinketh fitteſt: euen ſo, he which hath (by his practiſe) gotten good skill, and yet being of an other mans teaching, it is of an other manner of teaching, and I will not ſay but that it may be ſo good or better then mine: yet hee which learneth my rules or followeth my directions, it can not hinder him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit at all, but if hee haue once gotten them by good and perfect practiſe, if hee like them not, may goe to his olde faſhion againe, or learne of any other afterwards.</p>
            <p>Yet againe, as the obſeruing of a true diſtance in a Scriuener betweene euery line, is commendable in his writing, ſo it be done without ruling of it, which commeth by much practiſe; euen ſo in true skill in ſight, diſtance is a moſt excellent thing, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalleſt thing of all, next vnto the guard to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept, and it muſt be gotten by great pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, when you learne to write at the firſt, you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1116:38"/>write leaſurely, but with much practiſe your hand co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be ſwifter; euen ſo, with often vſe of thy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, thy hand will come to defend either blow, or thruſt more readily or more ſpeedily then at the firſt beginning of thy practiſe, albeit thou be ſhewen how to defend; and though thou haue the reaſon perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy head, and knoweſt when an other doeth it well, yet without practiſe thou canſt neuer be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in defence of thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Alſo, hee which writeth, and with his penne doth ſputter his paper with incke, a Scholler will thinke, if it be not a great blot, it is a ſmall matter, but a Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will ſay, it is a great fault; euen ſo, if thy weapon or any part of thy body be out of the right place, yea, though it be but a little, yet it will ſeeme to him that hath skill, as much as a great blotte doth to a Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a coppie Booke.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, he which learneth to write, muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually looke to his coppie, and muſt write according to it; for one letter, or one line well written, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a great deale of incke and paper ſpoiled, and not one letter well made: euen ſo, one blow, or one thruſt performed orderly, I meane, in his due time, and likewiſe to the right place, is better then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred vnorderly done.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if in writing an Obligation, a Scriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doe write one letter of Roman hand, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Secretary, another of Court hand, it will not be ſeemely, nor commendable, but with what hand you beginne with, to end with the ſame; euen ſo you may frame your ſelfe, ſomtimes into one guard, and ſometimes into an other, taking heed alwayes, that you obſerue the ſame defence which belongeth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1116:39"/>to the guard; for if you are in one guard, and you vſe the defence of another, ſo you may deceiue your ſelfe (for euerie guard differeth in defence and offence) and betwixt euerie blow, and euery thruſt, and euerie guard which I haue heere deſcribed in this Booke: there is as great oddes as is betwixt Secretarie hand, Court hand, and Roman hand: nay the ſeuerall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of guards are more in number then there are ſeuerall kindes of hands in writing, yea many more then any Fidler can play leſſons vpon his inſtrument, and the nature of the guards do differ as much as one leſſon from another; wherefore thoſe that thinke one defence ſerueth for defence of all guards, are aſmuch deceiued, as they that thinke there is but one kinde of leſſon to be played vpon all inſtruments: for that ſeuerall kindes of leſſons are to be played vpon all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are infinite; euen ſo, the ſeuerall guards for defence and offence are not to be numbred; for, betweene the true skill in weapons, and the falſe, are an hundred of each at the leaſt, and the contrarieſt and the moſt vnſeemely, euery man hath by nature, but the beſt and ſureſt way is to be learned by Art of them that are skilfull; wherfore ſee euery mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as thou mayeſt heare at one Sermon that which thou ſhalt neuer heare againe, euen ſo thou maieſt learne of one teacher, that thou canſt not learne of another: for euerie one that practiſeth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall play without direction of one that is skilfull, ſuch a one in his practiſe, will haue one fooliſh tricke or other: which when they haue by common practiſe long vſed, will hardly be withdrawne from it: as for example, ſome will be ſetting their foote vpon their weapons, as if it were to ſtretch him when hee was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1116:39"/>right before, but they do it of a fooliſh cuſtome that they learne of themſelues: likewiſe, ſome will puffe and blow like a broken winded horſe when they are at play, and ſome will daunce and keepe a trampling with their feete, and ſome will flouriſh and wauer with their weapons, ſome will whiſtle, and ſome will be blabbring of ſpittle in their mouthes, and putting out their tongues, and ſome againe will runne about as though they could ſtand on no ground, and it is as hard to wreſt or driue them from ſuch vnſeemely cuſtomes, as it is to driue a dogge from a peece of bread.</p>
            <p>Yet many doe not ſee it in themſelues, but vnto the skilfull, which beholde them, it will ſeeme very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, and by nature, euerie one hath the woorſt way; as for example, there are but two wayes for the bowing of the head, either to the right hand, or to the left, and by nature, euery one doth bow him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left ſide, rather ten to the right ſide; and there is very great oddes betwixt the right and the wrong in true defence, as I haue deſcribed in my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more at large, both in the place of Sword and Dagger, and Rapier and Dagger, for it is great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to leane thy head towards the right ſhoulder a little; and at the beginning of your practiſe it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie to frame your ſelfe to my faſhion, with ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding both with feete and bodie, for the vſe of the foote commeth not by nature, but by practiſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, many yoong men will be growne with ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and be ſo lazie, that they muſt be haled (as it were) with cartropes to any good exerciſe, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him their greateſt enemy which giueth them the beſt counſell, but to all folly they are prone and apt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1116:40"/>of themſelues, but perſwade them to any goodneſſe, and you ſhall ſee them hang arſe-ward like a dogge in a ſtring.</p>
            <p>Moſt youth, for example, are willing to goe to Schoole at the firſt, but within a weeke or leſſe, away muſt the booke be laid, for feare leſt much learning make them madde, as <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Paul,</hi> for they will waxe dull and weary with a little paines taking.</p>
            <p>And next, they muſt to the Fence Schoole, but there I am perſwaded they neede not learne offence, and I thinke a little defence is enough for them; for many will be wearie of well doing quickely, ſaying as the Porters of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> a new Maiſter, a new, and hang vp the old; euen ſo, from the Fence ſchoole they muſt goe to the Dauncing ſchoole, thinking that to be the onely exerciſe in the world, but with a little practiſe they waxe weary of dancing likewiſe: then they ſay, Oh that heere were one to teach Muſicke! that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe they ſhould neuer be wearie of, but within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while that will be too tedious a matter to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: ſo you may perceiue yong men (by their wills) will take paines at nothing, I meane, not one in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but what they are forced vnto.</p>
            <p>Now I doe not put downe thoſe vanities, heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Chapter expreſſed, thereby that thou ſhouldeſt waxe the worſe, by the reading of it, but I doe wiſh thee to marke others, and likewiſe examine thy ſelfe, that if thou ſee in others, or find in thy ſelfe ſuch fooliſhneſſe, refraine while thou art yong.</p>
            <p>Although many there be that do vſe fooliſh tricks, and perceiue them not in themſelues to be vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſuppoſe they become them well, as he that wauereth his weapon, or runneth about, wearieth him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1116:40"/>ſelfe: beſides, he that ſo runneth is in daunger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for a little ſhrub, buſh, briar, ſtone, or moule-hill, may ſoone ouerthrow him which doth not tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſe his ground leaſurely and orderly; for he which hath true defence muſt bee ſteadie in his guard with his foote and hand in their right place, whereas hee which wauereth his weapon is at no certaine guard for his defence; therefore, to keep ſteadie your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in their right place, is the beſt way: for, one blow, or one thruſt, orderly done, is better then an hundred without skill or out of order; for cunning in weapons may be compared to trickes at Cardes, for if one ſhew a tricke at Cardes, it will ſeeme ſtrange to him that neuer ſaw it before; but to him that can doe it, it is nothing troubleſome: euen ſo, as that tricke at Cardes is nothing when the ſecret is knowne, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie to be done: euen ſo, the beſt way at weapons, is as eaſie to bee followed (being knowne) as the worſt.</p>
            <p>Farre deceiued are thoſe which imagine they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine vnto the perfect skill of Defence with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and Dagger, without ſuch antique faſhions of learning, which many of late yeares haue deuiſed, ſome wreathing their bodies like vnto a coakes, and ſome, as though they were going to daunce the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, which maketh many that haue no experience at this weapon thinke it vnpoſſible euer to frame their bodies, as they ſee theſe doe, which I ſpeake of: but now theſe fantaſticall fellowes will perſwade a man, that it is not poſſible to play well at Rapier and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, except a man can frame his body as they do; but I ſay, the beſt and ſureſt way is the eaſieſt to be attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto; for a boy of fifteene yeares of age, may (by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1116:41"/>ſmall practiſe) defend himſelfe againſt any man, with his rapier &amp; dagger; for a thruſt with a rapier is more fearefull then with a ſword, and a man may ſee the thruſt better of a ſword then with a rapier, becauſe there is oddes in the breadth and bigneſſe each of the other. Againe, a man ſhall thruſt further with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier then with a ſword, for the hilt of a ſword will ſhorten your reach, by reaſon of the cloſeneſſe of the hilt, though they be both of one length.</p>
            <p>Yet many are of this opinion, and will ſay, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fight with a Sword and Dagger, then with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier and Dagger, the reaſon is (ſay they) with my Sword I may both ſtrike and thruſt.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, and by good experience I ſpeake if, that hee which ſtriketh in fight, giueth his enemie a great aduantage; beſides, a Sword may either bow or breake, and ſo by that meanes hee that ſtriketh may fall into his enemies mercy. Beſides that, a boy of fifteene yeares of age may ſafely defend the ſtrongeſt mans blow that is, according to my direction follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the firſt Picture; for a weake man, or a boy, may defend more with both his hands, then a ſtrong man can charge him with one; for many can not forbeare ſtriking, being moued thereunto by anger, except they haue beene grounded in the diſaduantage of it by much practiſe; hee that doth defend a blow dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and make a quicke anſwere with a thruſt, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his knockes inward, may hit any man that ſtriketh, and yet defend himſelfe without loſſe of time.</p>
            <p>For the defence of a blow double, is ſure, and yet you may anſwer your enemie ſo ſoone, and with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much danger to him as if you did defend it ſingle, for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1116:41"/>it may be all done with one motion, both the defence and offence.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I would counſell all Clothiers or Chapmen, which carrie many times more money then they are woorth, for their defence againſt falſe knaues, to carry a Staffe in their iournies, whether it be on horſe backe or on foote; for a good weapon doth not onely ſerue to keepe the peace, but alſo a mans purſe from a thiefe, and likewiſe to be experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the skill thereof, if they ſhould be driuen to encounter vpon a ſodaine at the like weapon. But a ſtaffe may eaſily encounter againſt a Sword and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, although but ſmall experience be in the Staffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but a little skill is a great help at a time of need, which if thou haſt not obtained in thy youth, then be not aſhamed to learne when thou art olde; for as in a ſchoole of learning, there are ſome in Grammer, and ſome in the Croſſe-row; ſo the greateſt Iudge in the land was in the Croſſe-row firſt: euen ſo into a ſchole of Defence there commeth, as well badde players, as good, and hee which is the good player ought not, nor it is not a thing vſuall to mocke or skoffe at him which is the badde player: and what of all this? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to ſhew, that it is better to learne late then neuer, I meane eſpecially any good exerciſe or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which is, or may be profitable for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, healthy to the bodie, and commendable to to the world, for we are not borne altogether for our ſelues, but our Parents, Friends, and Country haue intereſt in our birth.</p>
            <p>Now although ſome will talke of this and that, and ſay, that they haue fought with foure or ſixe men at once, yet I can conceiue no reaſon, how anie man
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1116:42"/>ſhould defend two men, eſpecially if they bee both willing to ſpoile, or kill; for when thine eie is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon one of them; the other, in the meane while, may kill thee, if he be diſpoſed; for the motion of the eie is flower then the motion of the hand; for a man cannot caſt his eie about ſo quicke, but that he which is behinde thee, or on the one ſide of thee, may kill thee, if they be both willing (as I haue ſaid before:) But indeede if one skilfull man haue two or three vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and be in a narrow place, that they can not get about him, then may hee defend himſelfe a long time without hurt.</p>
            <p>A left hand skilfull hath oddes againſt a right han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, one reaſon is, that a left handed man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vſed to a right hand, but a right hand doth ſeldome meete with a left handed man; another reaſon is, a right handed man, when he doth open his right ſide of his head, by offering play, although hee beare his Dagger to the right eare, yet it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that ſide, ſo ſure, nor ſo ſtrong as it doth the left ſide. But indeede, ſo long as the right handed man lieth in his guard of defence vpon his Backe-ſword, for the Backe-ſword is the chiefeſt poynt of defence againſt a left handed man; therefore when you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter againſt a left handed man, you muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and heedie, if you do offer play, to recouer your guard againe preſently, and be in the defence of your Backe-ſword guard: But of this I will ſpeake more at large heereafter.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That Feare and Fury are both enemies to true valour.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue taken vpon me a very hard queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to decide: for I can not well ſet out the office of the one, but with diſgrace of the other; the one is ſo cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the other: Firſt, that Feare is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy vnto valour, I neede not to make any long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for euery one will ſay, that the fearefull man will neuer attempt any thing worthy the name of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but alwayes beare a loade of injuries vpon his broade ſhoulders, excuſing all the wrongs which are done him, ſaying, that they were done with no intent of wrong, and ſo himſelf firſt crauing pardon of thoſe which offend him, but yet bearing an iniurie in his minde, vntill he can reuenge it, by vertue of an office, or one way or another; alſo, he is a raiſer of mutinies, and loueth to ſee other together by the eares, and yet keep himſelfe out of danger, but ſome I haue known, which haue bin timerſome and cowardly, ſhew great valour, but indeede it was when there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die but that they muſt needes fight. Againe, I haue knowne many ſimple cowardly men, who being well experienced with skill, and being practized therein, doe waxe bolde and valorous; for when (by often tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) they ſee that they can ſaue and defend themſelues, what neede haue they to feare, for there is a certainty of defence, and hee which hath it, may bee as ſure without making any doubt or queſtion, as it is for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetitian to caſt vp ſeuerall ſummes iuſt to a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: euen ſo certaine may a skilfull man be in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1116:43"/>and it is as eaſie to make a fearefull or coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, perfect in knowledge, and ſo by knowledge to bring him to be valorous; yea more eaſie it is then to make a haſtie man, of valour and ſtomacke, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare his former reſolution; for as no perſwaſions will make a drunkard forſake his drunkenneſſe, but onely pouertie or death: euen ſo there is almoſt no meanes to perſwade the furious and haſtie man from this ſodaine quarrelling and ſtabbing, but onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous wounds, impriſonment, or death: Yet if ſuch a one doe runne through many brawles, and ſo continue, vntill his owne rod hath beaten him, by croſſes and troubles: if all theſe can not make him liue ciuill, and in ſober faſhion, as he ought to doe, yet olde age will bring experience, and will make him as tame as a ſheepe; for when hee is olde, then hee will ſay, that a man ſhould not aduenture further then skill being tempered with diſcretion, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for obſerue I pray you, if you chance to ſee two skilfull men play or fight; and if theſe two fall into choller and furie, ſo that like two wilde Bulles they goe to it pell mell, then it is chance noddy to hitte or miſſe; for where fury hath the vpper hand it is not worth the ſight to the beholders, for they can ſhew no true Art, except they obſerue diſtance, for diſtance being broken, they cut or hurt one another which is a great diſgrace vnto true Art, and a diſcouragement to many which would learne skill, but that they ſee by ſuch haſtie fooles, that skill auaileth not, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it doth little auaile ſuch as cannot bridle their haſtie affections; but yet many will ſay it is true, yet they cannot beware of the diuell, vntill they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with his damme. For after a skilfuil man hath
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1116:43"/>receiued hurt he preſently condemneth his owne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for receiuing that which he might haue auoided if his mind had been on his buſineſſe; now as I would haue no man turn coward but to anſwer a good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, ſo likewiſe I would moſt earneſtly wiſh all men to forbear and not maintain ſuch light and idle braules which either ſpring from lewd women, as that are pot frayes, for drunkenneſſe is the cauſe of the moſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells that be, yet ſtill I doe allow and commend any man to anſwer his enemy vpon a good quarrell, and to ſtand againſt him, if he doe aſſault thee: for that wil make others to feare to doe thee wrong or thy friend wrong, thinking that thou wilt rite it. Now he which is valorous by nature, and hath no skill, and yet hath a good ſtrength, courage, and ſtomacke, many times doth aduenture raſhly without feare or wit, not much vnlike a fooliſh gameſter which vrgeth and neuer counteth vpon his fellowes game, but many times it were better hold then vie, for as ſom looſe their mony by their raſh vying at the one, ſo many looſe their liues by a fooliſh bold hardineſſe at the other: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their very firſt attempt, or as it were their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into hope to get the praiſe of the world to bee accounted valorous looſe their liues, which is for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of mixing diſcretion with ſtomacke.</p>
            <p>Many examples to this effect might bee ſhowne which hapned in the wars of <hi>France, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for in all theſe places as good men for valor as euer the Sun did ſhine vpon, loſt their liues vpon the very firſt attempt, onely by raſhneſſe, and ſo their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is written in a Chronicle of duſt, for it euen dyed with them.</p>
            <p>I hold it a greater credit to retreat for thine owne ſafety being in danger, rather then ſtill to charge one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1116:44"/>and ſo be ſlaine or ſore wounded, yet miſtake me not, for I doe not here commend running away neither, but vſe a meane and policy in retreating, for running away is a cowards defence. A good man may giue backe for his aduantage, and no diſgrace at all, if men of iudgement doe ſee it, and doe iudge with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the valianteſt Captaine that euer did breath, for his aduantage would retreat without any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at all, therefore he which will be accounted valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and runne through many dangers and bry ats of miſchiefe, quarrells and troubles of this world, he muſt many times be patient vpon a great wrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, but afterwards with diſcretion examin thy force and thy skill together, how thou maiſt without hazard of thy life reuenge the wrong offered, and that thou maiſt ſo fight as thou maiſt fight againe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looſing thy life vpon the firſt aſſault as many doe. but he is a foole which will aduenture all his goods in one ſhip, eſpecially if it be in a dangerous voyage, or all his mony at one throw at dice although hee know the runne of the dice neuer ſo well, for he that doth ſo may hap to looſe all. For there are many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers at ſea and many chances at dice, but a good quarrell doth halfe defend himſelfe, and alſo a good quarrell many times maketh a coward fight: againe, it is a great diſcredit to bee counted a run away, the vnskilfull muſt doe for his owne defence at ſomtimes and yet ſtomacke enough.</p>
            <p>Therefore whether it be in ſingle combat or other wiſe, vſe thy weapon with diſcretion, without choller or haſtineſſe, looking vnto thy buſineſſe which thou haſt in hand, ſoberly &amp; mildly, and let wiſedom guide the bridle, for ſo maiſt thou go through many a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1116:44"/>and run through many skirmiſhes often without hurt, although not without danger.</p>
            <p>There is no exerciſe learned but by often practiſe, for ſo it is made perfect: valor, and ſtomacke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by nature, but skill neuer commeth by nature, and he which is grounded in skill by arte and practiſe will not feare the proud brags of any man. But now if ſuch a one fight he vſeth his skill and dependeth chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly vpon it, but the haſty and furious man thinketh tſtat he is neuer neere enough, and ſo many of them neuer fight but once, for they are ſlaine in their owne haſtineſſe, the very firſt time of aduenturing; for haſte oftentimes maketh waſt.</p>
            <p>I doe remember a prety ieſt of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight as I haue heard it, that when he went to <hi>Bulloigne</hi> hee ſent out his Preſſe-maſters, commaunding them to bring all the luſtieſt hackers in the country, and they brought and preſented him with many that in fight had receiued many wounds, the skarres whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and the King beholding them ſaw that ſome of them had beene cut in the face in one place, and ſome in another, and ſome on the head, and ſome had loſt ſome of their ſingers; then ſaid the King vnto the Preſſe-maſters, I like theſe men well; but yet goe fetch me them which did cut thoſe fellowes, whereby he meant that thoſe which had the moſt hurts were not the beſt men.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How the vſe of weapons came, alſo the number of weapons vſed from time to time, with other good inſtructions.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN was firſt created naked, without any weapons naturally, ſauing onely hands and feete, which are able to make but a weake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt any great violence, onely this the hands to thruſt away that which may annoy vs, and the feete to run from that which may hurt vs. Now al other creatures except man are naturally armed with ſuch weapons as doth oftentimes kill and deſtroy any other beaſt which doth offend them.</p>
            <p>As for example, God in his creation furniſhed the Lyon, the Beare, the Dog, and the Wolfe, and other ſuch like beaſts, whith long and ſharpe teeth and clawes, and they are with them able to teare in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and deuour any man or beaſt, which they oppoſe themſelues againſt, now other beaſts there are whoſe ſtrength conſiſteth in other parts, and they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge themſelues in other manner; as the Vnicorne and the Bull, with their hornes, and the force of their heads, ſo that there is no other beaſt or creature is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abide the violence and force thereof.</p>
            <p>Alſo note the force of fowls of the ayre as the faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and the Eagle, what a dangerous weapon is the beake of them vnto ſuch fowles or beaſts as they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues againſt.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe for venemous beaſts, as the Serpent, the Viper, the Scorpion, and ſuch like, are ſo armed with poiſoned and venemous ſtings, which not onely ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth but hurteth and deſtroieth thoſe men or beaſts
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1116:45"/>commeth neare them.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe God in his creation made all creatures to ſeuerall purpoſes, but moſt of all for the vſe of man, for ſome he made to feed vs, ſome to cloath vs, ſome to ſport vs, and ſome to carry vs, and ſome to deſtroy vs.</p>
            <p>Loe thus much by the way of argument, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble to that which I intend to ſpeak of concerning weapons as followeth.</p>
            <p>In old time amongſt men the ſtrongeſt cary away the victory, I meane at that time when there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no other weapon vſed, but only tooth &amp; naile, hands and feet: now in thoſe dayes many men did thinke that they made a good hand when they ſaued themſelues by flight, or any other meanes, from thoſe which were to ſtrong for them, and ſo the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time, the ſtrongeſt ſtill carrying away the victory.</p>
            <p>For what weapons had they I pray you in the time of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> did not hee for want of other weapons with a law bone kill and deſtroy a thouſand Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims in a ſmall time without any hurt to himſelfe?</p>
            <p>Now at this time if there had been any weapons of more danger put the caſe this. Although <hi>Sampſon</hi> was charged vpon ſuch a ſuddaine wherby he had no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to arme himſelfe, yet you muſt vnderſtand and know, that his enemies came purpoſely to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon him, becauſe he had burned vp their corne: wherefore if there had been weapons they wold haue been ſo armed without all doubt or queſtion, and ſo prouided for him, that either they would haue woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or killed him, before he ſhould haue made ſuch hauocke or ſlaughter amongſt them.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1116:46"/>
            <p> Againe, what weapons had they when <hi>Saingar</hi> ſlue ſix hundred Philiſtimes with an oxe goade, as in the third of Iudges there you may read it in the laſt verſe.</p>
            <p>But after this as the number of people begun to multiply, and the malice, rage, and fury of man began to increaſe, firſt they began to reuenge themſelues with clubs, ſtaues, ſlings, and darts. And afterward they ſtudied and inuented other weapons and armor for wars, as at the firſt beginning of wars they made Iron chariots, and then they armed Elephants, and horſes, afterwards they found out the forging of ſwords, ſpeares, Bills, Halberts, Iauelins and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, Croſſe-bowes and long bowes, and ſuch like; and euery kind of weapon for more aduantage and danger one then another, ſtill changing onely to make triall of the beſt, for their aduantage, and ſuch they keepe in vſe that were of greater force not only to terrifie, but to hurt and deſtroy their enemies. But of late yeers they haue changed all weapons for mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Harquebuſh, and Croſſe-bowes, Calieuers, Pikes, Swords, and Rapiers, and ſuch like manly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of great danger, eſpecially vnto the ignorant and vnskilfull.</p>
            <p>Now therefore as we are prouided of ſundry kind of dangerous weapons, I could wiſh euery man to ſpend a little time in practiſing to learne skill and cunning at ſuch weapons, as with skill are moſt ſafe to defend, and yet moſt dangerous, and hurtfull to thy enemy, conſidering this that the skilfull and cunning man fighteth without feare; for not only thoſe which vſe the making of armes and weapons are well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, wherein many are accounted famous, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making a good liuing for their continuall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1116:46"/>but yet more accepted are they which can vſe weapons well both for defence and offence: for many thereby haue gotten ſuch credit through out all the world, inſomuch that Kings and Princes doe a dorne them which are excellent therein with the names of Knights, and ſome with greater titles of honor: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a great ſhame for any carrying the ſhape or perſonage of a man, but that he ſhould be ſo cunning and ſo furniſhed with skill and with continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, ſo to vſe it, as not only to defend thy ſelfe, but alſo to ſpeake and to diſcourſe of weapons and armes in what company ſoeuer thou come into fitting ſuch a matter.</p>
            <p>The Romans ſoone after the inuention of ſwords generally they grew ſo expert and cunning, that they were able and did ſet foorth whole armies of ſword-players, ſuch as are now called Fencers.</p>
            <p>It is a wofull ſight vnto the skilfull to ſee ſo many yong gentlemen, which being once blind folded with ignorance and for want of skill many times loſe their liues in fight, without reaſon or iudgement, and yet ſome ſuch there are which will aduenture; onely they doe it vpon an aſpiring mind, thinking thereby to get the praiſe of the world, which is to be accounted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, and tall men at armes, for to be accounted wiſe and valiant is euery mans deſire.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as amongſt the wiſe and ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that euer wrote, wee find the wiſe to prouide in ſummer for winter, in time of peace for wars; for ther is nothing ſo ſure but as that after peace there will come wars, there is no man liuing that although he carry himſelfe neuer ſo vprightly yet at one time or other he may bee ſo wronged that he muſt needes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1116:47"/>fight: therefore he that is wiſe will be armed before hand, not onely with weapons, but skill; thereby to preuent a miſchiefe if occaſion ſerue, as you ſhal hear more at large in the next Chapter.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Sheweth what an excellent thing skill is, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to all men to forbeare the maintaining of idle quarrels.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſhew you what skill is it will be a hard queſtion to decide, and a matter too deepe for me to handle, for we ſee daily many principall and cunning men euen at their wits end in ſtudying and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing skill and cunning in all arts and ſcience, and yet to the end of their liues they find themſelues igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in many things, and are ſtill to learne, yea euen in that which they haue alwayes bin trained vp vnto.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I think the ground of art and cunning is not to be found out, no although a man doe trauell more larger ground then the whole earth, or if hee ſhould flye aboue the clouds, or diue deeper then the ſea, all which is vnpoſſible: wherefore ſeeing it is ſo large that I cannot compas it, ſo high I cannot reach it, and ſo deepe a hidden ſecret, that I cannot ſound the bottom of it; for I cannot trauaile ſo far, climbe ſo high, nor wade ſo deepe, yet ſo farre haue I trauelled and ſo high haue I climbed, and ſo deepe haue I wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I ſee art &amp; skill ſo preuaile with thoſe which bendeth their minds thereunto, they become more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other ordinary men are, for skill is ſuch an excellent thing, that it abateth the choller and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1116:47"/>courage of the haſty and furious man, ſo that hee be tempered with diſcretion; euen as yron being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with ſteele, maketh a blade; whereas if it be all ſteele, it will be too brittle and ſoone broken; or all yron, then it will be too blunt: euen ſo, he which is furious and haſty will be ſoone killed. Againe, skill, vſe and exerciſe therein doth ouercome many ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which without it, are neuer to be left, as you ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>For, skill maketh thoſe hardy at their weapons, which are ſo timerſome, as they will wincke at euerie blow; yea, and if he were as fearefull and as coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Hare by nature, yet ſuch a one (by skill) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth, bold, hardy, and valorous; alſo (by vſe and practiſe) it maketh a man to vſe both his hands alike: wherefore I would haue no man that carrieth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage or ſhape of a man, but hee ſhould learne as much skill in his weapons as poſſible hee can; and likewiſe learne as many gards at each weapon as thou mayeſt, that thereby thou mayeſt be the better able to anſwer any man vpon a good quarrell, if his skill and cunning were neuer ſo good, but he which hath skill but at one weapon, and is acquainted but with one guard, and hath but one kinde of blow, or but one kinde of thruſt; I doe not ſee how ſuch a man ſhould bee able to defend himſelfe from one that is skilfull and cunning in many other guards, and many blowes and thruſts; for one guard, one blow, or one thruſt will quickely be worne threed-bare; it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that if a horſe did know his owne ſtrength, a man could not rule him; euen ſo, for want of ſuch manly knowledge, as euery one ought to be experienced in, doe neuer come to the knowledge of their ſtrength,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1116:48"/>nor dare not attempt any thing worth the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of manhoode, onely for want of experience and practiſe; for little doth any man know what good fortune is allotted out for him, and ſure the greateſt credite and honour that euer came to any man, was through skill in weapons: ſuch an excellent armour is Skill, that it maketh a man fight without feare: and he which hath it, will fight with ſuch warineſſe, that he will hurt, and not be hurt himſelfe, except it bee by great oddes of weapons, or more then one weapon at once.</p>
            <p>Hee which is a man of his hands will haue many tales brought him, but before thou giue any credite vnto a Tale-bearer, conſider well the condition of the meſſenger, before thou put any confidence in his ſpeeches, whether he be a drunkard, a coward, or a foole; for any of theſe three ſorts of men, there is no credite nor truſt to be giuen vnto their ſpeech. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a Gentleman, or a man of any good faſhion, ought not to carry tales: but if ſuch a one doe heare his friend wronged behinde his backe, he ought with diſcretion to anſwer him, in his friends behalfe, with reaſonable words, and not to report vnto his friend, the worſt that he heareth an idle fellow ſpeake, except it be a matter which concerneth his life, then it is not amiſſe to warne thy friend, to the end he may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided againſt ſuch a miſchiefe; but the carrying of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery idle tale betwixt man and man, doth much hurt, and ſetteth whole houſholds together by the eares. Againe, he which is a carrier of tales, can not truely deliuer a mans ſpeech, without adding or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and either of theſe two doe alter the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſpeech which was firſt deliuered, and it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1116:48"/>ſo falleth out many times, that the Tale-bearer brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelfe into many quarrells, and to be enuied on both ſides: therefore, he which can heare, and ſee, and ſay little, will finde moſt quietneſſe, for little ſaid is ſoone anſwered: but he that talketh much, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer place all his words well, nor pleaſe euery mans humour: and ſurely Tale-bearers are the breeders of great miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>For many times vpon others words ſome do beare malice one to another, without cauſe of deſert, and yet occaſion is taken, and perhappes none giuen nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the one party doth not know of the malice the other beareth him of a long time, and this is not well, for if thou be grieued, reueale thy minde, and make a bolt or a ſhaft of it quickely, either to end it with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons or with words or by the perſwaſions of friends, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, when it cometh in queſtion, and then afterwards be friends, but at no hand, let no enuious hatred remaine in thy heart againſt anie perſon, of what condition ſoeuer; but rather go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him which ſpake ill words againſt thee, and aske him in curteous meanes, but not in outrage and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, vntill thou heare his tale; for the Tale-bearer it may be, is in the fault, in telling a tale to make a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, when there is none meant.</p>
            <p>Meddle not with great men which are aboue thy calling, for though they wrong thee, and that thou haſt a good quarrel), yet thou canſt get little by maintaining ſuch a quarrell; for might (oftentimes) ouercommeth right, and the weakeſt goeth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the walles: then is it better to beare the burthen of the mighty, and indure their malice with patience and let ſuch quarrells ſlippe, rather then ſtirre further
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1116:49"/>in them, leſt it be thy ouerthrow: and, he carrieth the moſt honourable minde, which in talking of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, can ſo bridle his affections, as to vſe no railing, nor vndecent ſpeeches behind his enemies backe, for he that doth ſo, diſhoneſteth himſelfe: beſides, thoſe which heare him, will iudge that hee had rather fight with his tongue then with his ſword.</p>
            <p>Againe, a man of great power and authoritie ought not to offer wrong vnto any man of meaner ſort: for it hath beene often ſeene, that a worme being troden vpon, will turne againe; and many poore men will rather looſe their liues, if ſo twere they durſt aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to challenge the rich for feare of the Lawe, I do meane when they are oppreſſed, wronged, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by the rich and mighty men; for the Lawe is a quirke to reſtraine or to checke poore mens wills, for it doth hamper and temper, and bring them into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection: and as the olde Prouerbe goeth, The rich men haue the Lawe in their owne hands.</p>
            <p>Euen as the ignorant and vnskilfull do many times feare to diſpleaſe a ſwaggerer or a common quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; euen ſo poore men are afraide to offend the rich.</p>
            <p>Now concerning a rich man, I remember a prettie example or a tale, and as I heard it, you ſhall heare it, There was a Gentleman which built a gallant faire houſe, whom I will leaue nameleſſe, but he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ploughs and carriages for timber, lime, and ſtones; ſome ſeruing his preſent need, for loue, ſome for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſome for feare (as you ſhall heare) for at night, (when the carriage was ended) the Gentleman called them one after an other, and vnto the firſt hee ſaid; What haue you earned? Sir (ſaid he) I came for loue, and not for money. I thanke you (ſaid the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1116:49"/>So then he asked another, ſaying Sirra, what came you for? Sir (ſaid he) I am but a poore man, and I came for mony. And ſo the Gentleman payed him his wages: Then he called an other, and asked him wherefore he came, or what he had deſerued? Sir (ſaid he) I came not to you for loue, nor for money, but onely for feare of your diſpleaſure. Said the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, why art thou afraid of me which neuer did thee hurt in all my life? Yea, but ſir (ſaid he) I haue ſeene many poore men enuyed, wronged, and impriſoned many times for ill will by the rich, when they haue but little deſerued it; thereby ſhewing, that ſome rich men will beare ſuch malice vnto a poore man, if hee ſhall deny him ſuch carriage, or if hee doe not helpe him in the harueſt, or if hee ſhall denie him the ſelling of a horſe, ground, or cattell, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman hath a minde vnto; for many of them thinke that a poor man ſhold denie them nothing, but if they doe, a grudging hatred continueth vntill they haue reuenged it; but if in a long time they cannot finde a hole in his coate, whereby to reuenge their malice: yet when a preſſe commeth, then they put him forth for a Souldier, although there be twentie others in the ſame Pariſh, which would willingly ſerue, and likewiſe that might be farre better ſpared, and a great deale more fitte, for an vnwilling ſeruant ſeldome doth his maiſter good ſeruice.</p>

               <hi>Chap. X.</hi> The trickes of a Coward.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt reaſon which I will ſet downe, whereby you may know a coward, is, by the lading of himſelfe with weapons; for I haue knowne a very fearefull man to ſee to, and yet a coward, carry a Welch hooke vpon his backe, a cloſe hilted Sword and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet (miſtake me not) for I doe not call euery man that is ſo weaponed, a coward, but ſtand ſtill alittle, and you ſhall know who I meane.</p>
            <p>When a man (vpon a good quarrell) doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a coward into the field, it may be it commeth to this point; Where ſhall we meete ſaith the one? In ſuch a place or ſuch a place ſaith the other; but in the end, they make a ſecret concluſion, and choice of a place is agreed vpon; but then, if the coward goe into the field at all, hee will be ſure to goe where hee will not meete with his enemy, but to one of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named places, and there hee will ſtay a while, and if any company come by, hee will tell them, that he ſtayeth to fight with ſuch a man, becauſe they ſhall note him for a tall man of his hands: and then at his comming backe againe, amongſt his companions, he will bragge and boaſt that he hath beene in the field, to meete with ſuch a man, and he came not; when the other all the while was at the place where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to haue met.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſome cowards will ſo dare and bragge out a man in company, with ſuch ſwaggering words, whereby the heaters ſhould thinke there were not a better man to be found: and if it be in a Faire or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1116:50"/>then he will draw his weapons, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he ſhall be ſoone parted, for the people will ſay, that ſuch a one and ſuch a one made a great fray to day, but I account this but pot-valour, or a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fray to fight in the ſtreete, for a man can giue no due commendations of manhood vnto ſuch figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for there is no valour in it.</p>
            <p>Againe, I haue knowne a Coward cunningly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a very ſufficient man, and they haue met in the field, but at their meeting, the Coward will ſay thus vnto him, Now I ſee thou art a man, and I will take thy part againſt all men, but I will neuer drawe my Sword againſt thee, that which I did was but to trie thee.</p>
            <p>Alſo a cunning Coward, when hee hath wronged or miſ-vſed a man, the party grieued doth challenge the field of him, then hee will beare it out with great bragges and high lookes, enough to feare any man, that will be feared with words, ſhewing himſelfe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as though hee would fight indeede; for the Coward will ſay vnto the challenger, Thou wilt not meete mee, if I ſhould appoint thee a place, for thou dareſt nor anſwer me: for be it knowne vnto thee, if I vnſheathe my Sword, I will not draw him in vaine; but now if he ſee theſe bragges can not diſmay nor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage the furie of the other, but that hee will needes fight, then hee aſſayeth other wayes, if it be one of his acquaintance, hee will ſay, The world ſhall not ſpeake of it, that wee two ſhould fall out: or, if it be to an inferiour, then he will ſtand vpon his gentility, ſaying that he will not doe him that credite, for thou art a baſe fellow, a fellow of no faſhion, to compare with me. I haue knowne in a ſtrange place, that a ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1116:51"/>baſe fellow will ſtand ſo much vpon his gentilitie, and thinke to make the world beleeue he is a great man in his owne Countrey. Alſo, in a Tauerne or ſuch like place, if there be company ready to holde him, then he will draw his Dagger vpon very ſmal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſhewing himſelfe reſolute, as though hee would fight with the diuell; and then the company (with alittle perſwaſion) brings them friends, which I diſcommend not, but I diſcommend the falling out about a pipe of Tobacco, or a cuppe of Wine or Beere. But of this I haue ſpoken ſomething before, and ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more at large of it heereafter; But firſt, to end this I haue in hand, many a Coward may ſay, when he hath liued ſo long in the world vntill the world is weary of his company, I may be the beſt man in the world, for I was neuer yet tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor neuer drew my Sword in earneſt in all my life hitherto: againe, it is good ſleeping in a whole skinne.</p>
            <p>And a wiſe or a valorous man may euen ſay ſo as well as a Coward: for I ſay a man may very well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a good quarrell, if occaſion be offered, yet ſleep in a whole skinne; why ſhall wee feare to goe to our beddes, becauſe ſome die in their beddes; ſome die at Sea, and therefore ſhall we feare to croſſe the Sea; ſome fall by chance, ſhal we neuer therefore riſe for feare of falling? And what is all this? Nothing, but to ſhew, that there is leſſe danger in fighting a good quarrell with skill and diſcretion, vpon colde bloud: but of this I haue ſpoken ſufficiently already, if words would ſerue. But if I ſhould write a whole Volume of one matter, yet it would ſerue to ſmall purpoſe to ſome; and ſo where we left there we will beginne,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1116:51"/>for what I haue ſaid before, it is but as it were a deaw, but this laſt ſhower ſhall wet them to the skinne; a Coward will haue a Sword or a Rapier, for length (in a maner) like a halfe Pike: but ſince the vſe of ſhort Swords came, you cannot know them by that marke, as you might before, for many of them are got into the faſhion, and it is the fitteſt weapon that euer came for their purpoſe; for ſhort ſwords are worne both of one and other, more for the faſhion then for any other purpoſe: but becauſe men of good woorth doe weare them, therefore I will not call it the fooles faſhion, but let euerie man alone with his humour. Againe, a Coward will haue as good and as gallant a weapon as may bee gotten for money; but I doe not commend the man by the largeneſſe nor goodneſſe of his weapons, neyther hee that hath many hurts and ſcarres about his bodie. There is no due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to bee giuen of a Iudge, by his skarlet Gowne; neyther can a man commend the skilfulnes of the Marriner by his wearing of a great whiſtle: golde is not certainely knowne to be golde, before it is tried, euery thing is not as it ſeemeth to bee for many a man carrieth the ſhape and perſonage of a man: but when they come to the touch like golde to be tried, prooue but ſhadowes, as that which is like golde many times doth prooue worſe then Copper: euen ſo, there is no certaine true report can be giuen of a man touching manhoode vpon the firſt ſight, without ſome triall. You ſhall ſeldome ſee a Coward vſe his weapon, except it be vpon a drunken humour, or elſe, when he is driuen to it by extremity, and that he ſeeth no remedy, but that hee muſt needes fight, but he wil many times be drawing in ſome Ale-houſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1116:52"/>or Tauerne, and there hee will be fencing with him, and ſhewing his trickes, thinking to make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany beleeue, that hee is an excellent fellow of his hands: and there many will be hewing of bed-poſtes, or table-boords, or many ſuch like trickes he will vſe: then ſome Cowards will (by caſting abroad of libels) and by night-walking, doe many miſchieuous trickes, onely to reuenge a mallice which they beare in mind, becauſe they can not reuenge it manfully, and yet a Coward will grieue and fret if iuſtly hee heare any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be commended of any man for his manhoode and valour, for hee would haue no man better then himſelfe. And if ſuch a one beare office in Cittie or Towne, hee will at no hand abide to heare, that a maſter of Defence ſhould inhabite in the place where he gouerneth.</p>
            <p>Alſo if any other commend a man that is a man indeed, a coward will diſcommend him ſaying, he is no body; or he is not the man you take him for; with ſuch like diſabling ſpeeches, for if a coward cannot diſgrace a man with deeds to his face, then he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him with words behind his backe.</p>
            <p>Alſo a coward delighteth to breed quarrells betwixt man and man, and to ſet ſuch as are named to bee men of their hands, together by the eares by falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and by carrying of tales, and by making of molehills mountaines, of halfe a word a long tale, to the hurt of others, and no good to themſelues: and what is the chiefe cauſe of all cowardly mindes but onely ignorance, and want of skill: but to conclude, neuer truſt a coward in his fury, nor ſuffer him not to come neerer then the point of thy rapier, and there let him tell his tale, but let him haue no aduantage
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1116:52"/>vpon thee by no kind of illuſions, eſpecially if he be thy profeſſed enemy.</p>
            <p>That he is a coward which practiſeth the throwing of a dagger or the darting of a rapier, I will not ſay, but he which putteth it in practiſe vpon a man, is a coward, for if he kill a man with ſuch a tricke, in my mind it is pitty but he ſhould die for it: and ſo I will end with that example of a cowardly murtherer of one <hi>Cosbe,</hi> whoſe murthering hands by a couſening deuice bereaued the Lord of <hi>Burke</hi> of his life, and as I heard it, thus it was: a quarrell grew between them, and the field was appointed, where they both met, and being ready to charge each other, <hi>Cosbe</hi> ſaid my Lord you haue ſpurs which may annoy you: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you pleaſe put them off, and euen as he was vnbuckling of his ſpurs, this cowardly and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring minded <hi>Cosbe</hi> ran him through with a mortall wound, whereof he died preſently.</p>
            <p>Now to my owne knowledge, my Lord <hi>Burke</hi> was very skilfull in his weapons, and ſufficient to haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered any man beeing equally weaponed, or vpon equall termes, therefore hard was his hap to meet with ſuch a cowardly murtherer, for his death is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of many, and <hi>Cosby</hi> was hanged for it.</p>
            <p>Yet touching this matter, here followeth another example, as I heard it I will declare it: thus, there was a murtherer who eſcaping the pittifully hands of the mercifull Iudge, after he had killed two men, being taken and apprehended for the third murther, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arraigned before the ſame Iudge which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed pitty, began now to condemne this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, and giue the ſentence of death, and ſo began to declare to this murtherer that had ſmall grace,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1116:53"/>which could not beware being twice warned, but muſt now kill the third man: therefore thou (ſaith the Iudge) well deſerueſt death, &amp; death thou ſhalt haue: when the murtherer ſaw that he muſt die, he ſaid thus vnto the Iudge: My Lord you doe me wrong to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me for the killing of three men, for it was you that killed two of them: yea ſaid the Iudge, how can that be? marry thus: if you had hanged me for the firſt I had not killed the other two: therefore it is pitty in my mind, that a man-ſlayer ſhould liue to kill two men, but to be hanged for the firſt if it be not in his owne defence, or vpon a very good quarrell, and ſo I will ſtrike ſaile for a while.</p>

               <p>Then I hold it neceſſary for thee to learne the perfect vſe of ſixe kinds of weapons, not that thou ſhouldeſt ſtill bee armed with ſo many weapons, but with the skill of them, for that will not burthen thee nothing at all: for thou maiſt in trauell by chance meet at ſundry times, with ſundry men, which are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſundry kind of weapons, now if thou bee prouided before hand with skill at ſuch a weapon, as by chance thou maiſt meet withall, knowing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               <p>The firſt and two principall weapons are the rapier and dagger, and the ſtaffe, the other fowre are the back ſword, the ſingle Rapier, the long ſword and dagger, and the ſhort ſword and dagger, but with the two former weapons thou maiſt encounter by skill with any man in the world, the rapier and dagger againſt any weapon of the ſame length, at ſingle hand and with a ſtaffe againſt any two handed weapon, as againſt the welch hooke, two hand ſword, the Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd, Partiſan, and gloue, or any other weapon of the like aduantage: but prouided alwayes thou muſt be ſure armed with skill at thoſe two eſpecially: and with all the reſt if thou canſt, for then maiſt thou bee the bolder to encounter with any man at any of the other, if thy enemy charge thee vpon the ſuddaine with a contrary weapon, thou wilt preſently know what thy enemy can doe with his weapon, which if thou haſt no skill in, it will ſeeme the more fearefull vnto thee.</p>
               <p>For if <hi>Golias</hi> had been experienced in the cunning of a ſling, hee would not haue condemned <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo raſhly, nor made ſo light account of him as he did: but if thou haue skill with ſuch a weapon, as thou art to encounter againſt, it will be nothing troubleſome vnto thee, for there is no way to hit, but there is a way to defend, as thou ſhalt here more at large, but firſt tell me what thou art, and thy bringing vp.</p>

               <p>I was a yeomans ſonne, and always brought vp idle vnder my father, but now my father is dead, and that little which he left mee for the moſt part I

            <sp>
               <speaker>Maſter.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed meanes to liue and a good name withall, is more then gold, and becauſe thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe willing to be inſtructed, thou ſhalt heare briefly what I would doe if my ſelfe were in thy caſe, for if I ſhould enter into large diſcourſes I might thereby well make thee weary with the hearing of it, but perhaps neuer the wiſer, and ſo thereby thou mighteſt well giue me occaſion to account the time very ill ſpent in writing of it. Neuertheleſſe I will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon little of my labour, for I am in hope to doe thee good, for thou muſt or ſhouldeſt know not only how to vſe and gouerne thy weapon, but alſo thy ſelfe, in all companies, and in all places, where thou ſhalt happen to come; for kinde and curteous behauiour winneth fauour and loue whereſoeuer thou goeſt, but much the better if it be tempered with manhood and skill of weapons. Now ſome will ſay that skill in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons is good moſt chiefly for gentlemen, but I ſay it ſhould be in all men, for I haue known and ſeen many poore mens ſonnes come to great honor and credit, and chiefly it was becauſe they had skill in weapons, wherefore in my mind it is the moſt excellent quality of all both for high and low, rich and poore. But when thou art experienced at thy weapon, I would wiſh thee to make choice of one of thoſe three exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes for thy continuall expences and maintenance ſo long as thou liueſt, and not liue like a drone vpon

               <p>Marry, thy ſelfe being of reaſonable good yeares, and hauing neither lands, nor but alittle li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left thee, chooſe whether thou wilt goe learne ſome trade or occupation, or elſe goe into the wars, or be a ſeruing man; for when thou haſt skill in thy weapon, thou muſt haue ſome meanes to maintaine thine expences; for idle hands will make a hungrie bellie, and a hungrie bellie muſt needes haue meate, and meate will not be bought in the market for hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie without money.</p>

               <p>I commend them all, but yet an occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a more certaine ſtay vnto a man, both in his youth and in his age, then any of the other two are; and as thou art in yeares, ſo oughteſt thou to bee the more witty, if it be not ſo, it ſhould be ſo, and a man of reaſon will the ſooner be his craftſ-maſter. A man is neuer too olde to learne, eſpecially any thing that may be to the good and profit of the commonwealth; and it is better to learne late then neuer: and he that hath a trade, let him looke vnto it, and hee which will not labour, let him not eate, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>

               <speaker>Maſter.</speaker>
               <p>Such a trade or occupation, as thy minde bendeth moſt vnto, and then to apply thy ſelfe to it, and follow it, and ſtriue by honeſt meanes and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour to be rich, for thou mayeſt be poore when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1116:55"/>thou wilt, but there is no trade good to him which will not to follow it, for he that hath neuer ſo many trades, and yet giueth his mind to drunkenneſſe, and loueth to leade an idle and loytering life: ſuch a one will neuer thriue, but fit in an Ale-houſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that the world is hard, and that worke is very ſcant; indeede, ſo it is with ſuch a one, for a man can ſeldome finde them in their owne houſes, whereby to put worke into their hands, but thoſe that doe looke for worke, and attend it, need neuer to want worke, but will alwayes be in other mens worke, or elſe they will be able (by their good husbandry) to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aworke, and it is a very bad commoditie, that will not yeelde mony at one time or other.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Do you vnderſtand me? if not, I will make it more plaine, hearken to that which followeth, then aboue all, giue not thy minde to ranging or running from Towne to Towne, or from Countrey to Countrey, for a rolling ſtone will neuer gather moſſe, the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper will rather die then goe out of the graſſe; and thou (with good behauiour) mayeſt better liue with a groat in thine owne Countrey, then with a pound in a ſtrange place, for in a ſtrange place, although thou be of good behauiour, yet many will feare thee, and be loath to giue thee credite, and will thinke, if thou wert of good behauiour, thou ſhouldeſt haue had no neede to come out of thine owne Countrey: Againe, thy flying away will be a great diſcredite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, if thou thinke to come home againe; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man almoſt will be loath to put credite, or anie thing of valew into the hands of a ranger, becauſe that they are not reſolued that thy minde is ſetled to ſtay in thine owne Country, when thou doſt turne
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1116:55"/>from thy race againe. Many men there are that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their time in ranging abroade, and at the laſt, ſeeing the vanity of the world, they recall themſelues, and repent of the time which they haue conſumed in trauell: but then they haue experience although no money; now Experience is no coiner, nor a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man woorth a pinne without his tooles; for what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth it to be a cunning Gold-ſmith, and haue ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gold nor ſiluer: few there are that will truſt a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller any further then they can ſee him, eſpecially, if hee haue beene one that hath ſerued as a Souldier in a forreine Countrey: therefore, although home be homely, indeuour thy ſelfe to liue by honeſt and good meanes, and be contented with thine homely home; but beware, ſpend not Michaelmaſſe rent in Midſummer quarter abroade, as many bad husbands vſe to doe.</p>
            <p>Now if a trade be too tedious for thee to learne, or too painefull for thee to follow, then goe thou vnto the warres, and ſerue eyther by Sea or Land, as thy affections ſhall beſt leade thee vnto: but in ſeeking by the warres to get wealth, if thou looſeſt thy life while thou art yoong, thou needeſt not to care for olde age; yet by the warres (if fortune ſerue) but to ſpeake more Chriſtian-like (if God will) thou maieſt get that in one houre, which (with good diſcretion and gouernement) thou mayeſt be the better for, ſo long as thou liueſt: the goods which do come by the warres, are neyther light come by,<note place="margin">The warres are not like throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſnowe balles: farre deceiued are they that ſo thinke.</note> nor godlily got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (in my minde;) yet many thinke that wealth got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the warres, is eaſily gotten; for ſo it appeareth by the prodigall and vaine ſpending of it: wherefore I would haue thee furniſh thy ſelfe with Diſcretion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1116:56"/>and Knowledge before hand, that thereby thou maiſt the better vſe wealth when thou haſt it; but then thou muſt not abuſe it, as many other Souldiers haue done heretofore: for I haue knowne many get both goods and money by the warres, but haue made no other reckoning, but as one would ſay, lightly come light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe; and ſo ſuffering it to melt away like butter in the Sunne: therefore if thou happen, by the warres, vpon that may doe thee good, keepe it warily, and ſpend it wiſely: for it is ſaid, a dog ſhall haue a day, and a man ſhall haue his time; but if he let Time ſlip, ſhe is bauld behinde, and therefore no holde to be taken of her after her backe is once turned; for I haue knowne many by the wars, get at one voyage, enough to liue by all their liues long, if with diſcretion it had bin gouerned; but they haue conſumed it in ſo ſhort a time, that a man would thinke it impoſſible; and then to the warres againe they go in hope of the like fortune, but they haue not in ſeauen yeares, nay all their life time got ſo much, as they ſpent in one day, when they had crownes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Goods gotten by the warres are like a liue Bird in the hand, which, the hand no ſooner opened but ſhe ſtrait flieth away.</note>Then conſider with thy ſelfe, that if thou doe light vpon wealth, that thou commeſt not light by it, if thou get it by the warres, though indeede it is gotten in an houre, yet it is gotten with great hazard of thy life, and no doubt it is diſpleaſing to God, for goods gotten by the warres ſerue but for ſpending mony for the time preſent; thoſe which doe ſaue them, and hoord them vp, they are conſumed before two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations doe paſſe, yea though it were aboundance, it cometh to nothing, as in my farewell to <hi>Plimmouth</hi> more at large appeareth.</p>
            <p>Now (in my minde) the third and the worſt choiſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1116:56"/>I haue left till the laſt, and that is a ſeruing-mans life, yet it is as it happeneth, for ſome happen into good ſeruice, and ſome againe ſpend ſeauen yeeres, yea all their life time, and ſo they grow the older, little the wiſer, nor neuer a whit the richer; and ſome of them neuer care ſo they haue from hand to mouth, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinke vpon a rainy day vntill it come, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are wiſe for they will not keepe a dog and barke themſelues, neither will they keepe a cat except ſhee will catch mice; therefore if thou wilt be a ſeruing-man thou muſt take great paines, otherwiſe thou wilt haue ſmal gaines at the end of thy ſeruice; yea though thou be neuer ſo painfull and dutifull, yet when thou lookeſt to receiue thy reward, there may be ſuch great fault found in thy ſeruice, that all the golden words and faire promiſes which thou haſt been deluded and haled forward withall, they may all come to nothing except thy bare wages, there may be a bill of caueling put in for the reſt, ſaying if thou hadſt been an honeſt man, thou ſhouldeſt haue had this or that, if thou liue neuer ſo vprightly, yet there may be faults found, for it is a very eaſie matter to find a ſtaffe to beat a dogge withall, but becauſe I cannot well diſplay the life of a ſeruingman, but either I ſhall diſpleaſe the Maſter or the man, or both; therefore I will here conclude, and leaue the reſt to thy daily experience, and ſo for a while harken vnto the skill of weapons.</p>

            </list>
            <p>THe firſt is to learne a good and a ſure gard for the defence of thy body, as when you come to the vſe of weapons, as heere preſently after ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and when thou haſt thy gard it is not enough to know it, but to keep it ſo long as thou art within reach or danger of thy enemy.</p>
            <p>To obſerue diſtance, by which is meant that thou ſhouldeſt ſtand ſo far off from thine enemy, as thou canſt, but reach him when thou doſt ſtep foorth with thy blow or thruſt, and thy foremoſt foote and hand muſt goe together, the which diſtance may be twelue foot with a rapier, or with aſword fowre foote long, and yet thy beſt foot which ſhould be the hindermoſt foot of a right handed man, ſhould bee mored faſt and keepe his ſtanding without moouing an inch, for then he will be the readier to draw backe thy fore foot and body into the right place of diſtance againe for that thou muſt doe vpon euery charge, whether thou hit thy enemy or not; whereas if in ſtepping foorth with thy fore-foot, when thou doſt charge thy enemy either with blow or thruſt, thou ſuffer thy hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot to dregge in after the other, then thou brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy diſtance, and thereby endangereſt thy body.</p>
            <p>There is no way better to get the true obſeruation of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1116:57"/>diſtance, but by often practiſe either with thy friend, or elſe priuately in a chamber againſt a wall, ſtanding twelue foot off with thy hindermoſt foote, and thy weapon fowre foot long or there about, for a good gard and diſtance are the maine and principal points of all.</p>
            <p>To know the place, this may be taken three wayes, as this, the place of thy weapons, the place of defence and the place of offence: the place for the holding of thy weapons, thou ſhalt know when thou commeſt to it as I ſaid before, but it is chiefly meant heere the place of offence; thou muſt marke which is the neereſt part of thine enemy towards thee, and which lyeth moſt vnregarded, whether it be his dagger hand, his knee, or his leg, or where thou maiſt beſt hurt him at a large diſtance without danger to thy ſelfe, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing of thine enemy.</p>
            <p>To take time, that is to ſay when opportunity is profered thee, either by his lying vnregarded or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy enemies profer, then make a quicke anſwer, I meane it muſt be done vpon the very motion of his profer, thou muſt defend and ſeeke to offend all at once, for thou muſt not ſuffer thy enemy to recouer his gard, for if thou doe thou looſeſt thy aduantage. But thou muſt anſwer him more quicker then I can ſpeake it, for if thou looſe thy anſwer, and charge thy enemy when he is garded, thou giueſt thy enemy that aduantage which thou mighteſt haue had thy ſelfe, for he which maketh the firſt aſſault doth endanger himſelfe moſt, if he be not very expert and cunning in his buſineſſe, otherwiſe a man of reaſonable skill may hurt him by making a quicke anſwer.</p>
            <p>To keepe ſpace this may be conceiued two wayes;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1116:58"/>the one in the ſpace between thy enemie &amp; thy ſelfe, this I call diſtance, and I haue already ſpoken of it; but the ſpace which in this place I will ſpeake of, is to aduiſe thee to keepe a certaine ſpace betwixt euery aſſault, I meane if thou charge thy enemy either with blow or thruſt, recouer thy weapons into their place, and draw thy ſelfe into thy gard againe, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring thy ſelfe for to defend, and likewiſe to make a freſh aſſault with diſcretion, but not charging thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy raſhly or furiouſly, for haſtineſſe is fooliſhnes: for if fury haue the vpper hand, and ſo you both ſtrike and thruſt, without reaſon and iudgement, I ſay in ſuch a caſe the skilfulleſt man that is, may be ſo well hit as he hit another.</p>
            <p>The next is patience, and that is one of the greateſt vertues that can be in a man: the Wiſe man ſaith, he is a foole which cannot gouerne himſelfe, and he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnfit to rule which cannot rule himſelfe; therefore, though thou be haſtie or cholericke by nature, and by croſſing thou art moued vnto anger; yet I ſay, let the bridle of Reaſon and Iudgement ſo gouerne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-rule thy haſtie affections, that in no caſe Anger get the vpper hand; But of this there is more at large ſpoken in the eight chapter. Now the laſt thing that I will note heere, is often practiſe, for without pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the Prouerbe ſayes, a man may forget his <hi>Pater noſter:</hi> for practiſe (with moderation) is, not onelie the healthieſt thing in the world for the bodie: but it is likewiſe as defenſiue for the ſame. For skill to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reaſonable man is a friend, ſo that with moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it be vſed, and ſo long as it remaines in thoſe of good temper; for vnto ſuch, skill bringeth no more preſumption nor furie then as if they had it not: for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1116:58"/>in the field, thoſe which I meane will vſe it as if they were in a Schoole, by which meanes ſuch haue great aduantage of the ignorant and vnskilfull; for thoſe which are vnskilfull, are neither certaine of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence nor offence; but what they doe is vpon a kinde of fooliſh bolde hardineſſe, or as I may ſay by hap-hazzard or chance noddy: and therefore (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) reſolue vpon skill and knowledge which follows heere immediately.</p>

               <p>KEepe thy rapier hand ſo low as the pocket of thy hoſe at the armes end, without bowing the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow ioynt, and keepe the hilt of thy dagger right with thy left cheeke, and the poynt ſomething ſtoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping toward the right ſhoulder, and beare him out ſtiffe at the armes end, without bowing thine elbow ioynt likewiſe, and the poynt of thy Rapier two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches within the point of thy dagger, neyther higher, nor lower; but if the point of thy rapier be two or three inches ſhort of touching thy dagger, it is no matter, but if they ioyne it is good; likewiſe, keepe both your points ſo high as you may ſee your enemy cleerely with both your eies, betwixt your rapier and dagger, and bowing your head ſomthing toward the right ſhoulder, and your body bowing forwards, and both thy ſhoulders, the one ſo neere thine enemie as the other, and the thombe of thy rapier hand, not vpon thy rapier, according vnto the vſuall faſhion of the vulgar ſort, but vpon the naile of thy fore-finger, which will locke thine hand the ſtronger about the

               <p>Carrie the edge of thy rapier vpward, and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for then thou ſhalt defend a blow vpon the edge of thy rapier, by bearing thy rapier after the rule of the Backe-ſword, for this is the ſtrongeſt and the ſureſt carriage of him.</p>
               <p>But now it is but a vaine thing to goe about to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe after my direction, except thou vnderſtand my meaning, and follow my counſell, as by words ſo plaine as I can, I haue ſet downe, both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for if thou obſerue one thing, and not an other, it will profit thee but little, as thus: if thou place thy
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1116:59"/>weapons in order; and then, if thy hand, foote, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be out of order, then it will be to ſmall purpoſe to proceed in thy practiſe: againe, if thou frame thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die right, and thy weapons, and thy hand, and thy foote; yet if thou do not obſerue a true diſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, then thy practiſe will be little auaileable to thee: wherefore at the firſt beginning of thy practiſe, take a good aduiſement, and be perfect by often reading of this Booke, ſo to beginne well; for if thou haſt beene vſed to ſet thy feete abroad in thy former practiſe, as moſt men doe, then it will be hard for thee to leaue thy old wont.</p>
               <p>Now, if thou wilt breake thy ſelfe of that faſhion and practiſe after my rules, then will I ſhew thee by and by; for when thou haſt my faſhion, thou mayeſt goe to thine owne againe when thou wilt, if in triall thou finde it better.</p>
               <p>The beſt way to bring thy feete to a ſure ſtanding, both for defence and offence, is when thou doſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe with thy friend or companion; at the firſt get thy backe to the wall, and let him that playeth with thee ſtand about twelue foote diſtance, and ſet thy left heele cloſe to the wall, and thy right foote heele to the great ioynt of the left foote great toe, and when thou intendeſt to offend thy enemy, either with blow or thruſt, then ſteppe forth with thy right foote, and hand together, but keepe thy left foote faſt moared like an anchor, to plucke home thy body and thy right foote into his place and diſtance againe; vſe this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion but three or foure times, and it will bring thee to a true ſtanding with thy foote, and it will be as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to thee as any other way; whereas if thou practiſe in a large roome without any ſtoppe to ſet thy foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1116:60"/>then will thy left foote be alwayes creeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſo that although thou wouldeſt refraine the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting abroad of thy feet, yet thou canſt not, eſpecially if thou haſt been vſed to ſet them abroad heretofore.</p>

Alſo haue a ſpeciall care that thou be not too buſie in making of play, though choller or ſtomacke prouoke thee thereunto. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, in ſtanding in thy guard, thou muſt keepe thy thighes cloſe together, and the knee of thy fore legge bowing back-ward rather then forward, but thy bodie bowing forward; for the more thou holloweſt thy bodie, the better, and with leſſe danger ſhalt thou breake thine enemies thruſt, before it cometh neare to endanger thy bodie; and when thou breakeſt a thruſt, thou muſt but let fall the point of thy dagger, but not thy dagger arme, for ſome will throw their dagger arme backe behinde them when they breake a thruſt; he that ſo doth cannot defend a ſecond thruſt if his enemy ſhould charge him againe ſodainely.</p>

               <head>The reaſons of this guard.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, the points of your weapons being cloſed, your enemy cannot offend you with a wriſt blow, which otherwiſe may be ſtrucke to your face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your points: likewiſe, there is a falling thruſt that may hit any man which lies open with his points by following it into his face or breaſt, and thruſting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1116:61"/>it home withall: alſo, if you carrie your rapier point vnder your dagger, your own rapier may hinder you, for by turning downe of your daggar point, to defend the bodie from your enemies point, according vnto the firſt of the foure defenſible waies, as hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: then your owne dagger may hit your owne rapier, and ſo your rapier will be as it were a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, ſo that you cannot diſcharge your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thruſt cleane from your bodie; and alſo by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your dagger vpon your rapier wilbe a hindrance vnto you, that you cannot make a quicke anſwer, by chopping out your point preſently vpon your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: for if you haue anie hindrance at all, then your chiefe time of offence is ſpent, for before you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer your rapier, your enemie will haue recouered his guard, and he being in his guard your proffer of offence is in vaine: for if you will hit your enemie, your offence and defence muſt be done all with one motion, whereas if you continue a ſpace betwixt your defence and your offence, then is your beſt time of offence ſpent, for when your enemie chargeth you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with blow or thruſt, at that verie inſtant time, his face, his rapier, arme, ſhoulder, knee, and legge are all diſcouered, and lie open, except the oppreſſour be verie cunning in recouering his guard haſtily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or he may defend himſelfe with his dagger, if he beare him ſtiffely out at the armes end, for in your offence the dagger hand ſhould be borne out ſo farre as the rapier hand goeth, which muſt be done by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and great carefulneſſe; for many when they doe make their aſſault, they will put out their rapier, and plucke in their dagger, thereby endangering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues greatly: for except that the dagger arme bee

               <head>A thruſt may be defended foure waies.</head>
               <p>THe firſt is with the dagger, onelie by turning of the point downe, and turning thy hand-wriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout withall, without bowing the elbow ioynt of thy dagger arme, but onelie turning thy dagger round, making as it were a round circle, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bring vp the point of thy dagger in his place againe.</p>
               <p>Now the ſecond defence is with the dagger like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but then you muſt beare the hilt of your dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo lowe as your girdle-ſteed, and the point more vpright then is deſcribed in the firſt picture, and in your defence of a thruſt, you muſt beare your dagger hand ſtiffe ouer your bodie, without letting fall the point but ſtill keeping him vpright.</p>
               <p>The third waie to breake a thruſt, is, with the ſingle rapier; this defence will defend all thy bodie from a thruſt againſt a rapier and a dagger; and likewiſe it is a ſure defence for thine hand, if thou haue not a cloſe hilted dagger, when thy enemie doth proffer a thruſt, plucke in thy dagger hand, and put out thy rapier arme, and beare him ouer thy bodie, the point bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward thy left ſide, breaking the thruſt with the edge of thy rapier, keeping thy point vpright: but when I come to the ſingle rapier, then you ſhall ſee it more at large.</p>
               <p>The fourth way is to defend a thruſt with both your weapons together, and that you may doe three ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies, either with the points of both your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1116:62"/>vpwards, or both downeward, vpward you may frame your ſelfe into two gards, the firſt is according as I haue deſcribed afore, the points being cloſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the picture, ſo carrie them both away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt your enemies thruſt breaking towards your left ſide; the other high guard is to put your ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier on the out-ſide of your dagger, and with your dagger make a croſſe, as it were, by ioyning him in the middeſt of your rapier, ſo high as your breaſt, and your dagger hilt in his vſuall place, and to defend your thruſt, turne downe the point of your rapier ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, and force him downe with your dagger, by letting them fall both together: this way you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a thruſt before it come within three foot of your bodie; and this way defendeth the thruſt of a ſtaffe, hauing but onelie a rapier and dagger, as you ſhall heare more when I come to the ſtaffe: for it is good to be prouided with the beſt way, if a ſodaine occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be offered: and for the blow of a ſtaffe, you may verie eaſily defend with a Rapier and Dagger, by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him double; and ſo hauing defended the blow, goe in haſtily vpon him, for there is no ſtanding out long againſt a ſtaffe, and ſo likewiſe vpon defence of a thruſt you muſt be verie nimble in your going in within the point of his ſtaffe, I mean ſo ſoone as your enemies thruſt is paſſed vnder your Rapier arme, for that way the thruſt of the ſtaffe ſhould goe.</p>

               <head>Three manner of waies for the holding of a Rapier.</head>
               <p>THere are three waies for the holding of a Rapier, the one with the thumb forward or vpon the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier blade, and that I call the naturall faſhion, there
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1116:62"/>is another way, and that is with the whole hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pummell of thy Rapier, and the thumbe lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the fore-finger, or elſe they muſt both ioyne at the leaſt: this is a good holding at ſingle Rapier.</p>
               <p>Then the third is but to haue onelie the fore-finger and thy thumbe within the pummell of thy Rapier, and thy other three fingers about thy pummell, and beare the button of thy pummell againſt the in-ſide of thy little finger; this is called the Stokata faſhion, and theſe two laſt are the ſureſt and ſtrongeſt waies: after a little practiſe thou maieſt vſe them all three in thy practiſe, and then repoſe thy ſelfe vpon that which thou findeſt beſt, but at ſome times, and for ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all theſe kindes of holding thy Rapier may ſtead thee, for a man may performe ſome manner of ſlips and thruſts, with one of theſe three ſortes of holding thy weapon; and thou canſt not doe the ſame with neither of the other: as thus, thou maieſt put in a thruſt with more celeritie, holding him by the pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, and reach further then thou canſt doe, if thou holde him on either of the two other faſhions.</p>
               <p>Againe, thou maieſt turne in a ſlippe, or an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand thruſt, if thou put thy thumbe vpon thy Rapier according as I haue ſet it downe, calling it the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faſhion, and is the firſt of the three waies for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Rapier; and this faſhion will bee a great ſtrength to thee, to giue a wriſt blowe, the which blow a man may ſtrike with his Rapier, becauſe it is of ſmall force, and conſumes little time, and neither of the other two faſhions of holding wil not perform neither of thoſe three things; for if thou holde thy rapier either of the two ſecond waies, thou canſt not turne in a ſlippe, nor an ouer-hand thruſt, nor giue a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1116:63"/>wriſt blow ſo ſpeedily, nor ſo ſtrong: wherefore it is good to make a change of the holding of thy weapon for thine owne benefite, as thou ſhalt ſee occaſion: and likewiſe to make a change of thy guard, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as thou ſeeſt thy beſt aduantage; I meane if thou be hardly matched, then betake thee vnto thy ſureſt guard, but if thou be matched with an vnskilful man, then with skill thou maieſt defend thy ſelfe, although thou lie at randome.</p>
               <p>The reaſon that your points ſhould be ſo high, as you may ſee your enemie plainely and cleerely vnder them, is for a ſure defence of a blowe, if your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhould charge you therewith to either ſide the head, then beare them both double together, and hauing defended the blowe, preſently turne downe the point of your Rapier toward your enemies thigh, and with turning your knuckles inward, ſteppe forth with foote and hand together, whether you hitte or miſſe, retreit nimbly into your guard and diſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>And although I doe aduiſe you to keepe the point of your Rapier ſo high, yet withall I doe warne you, that you maie haue a ſpeciall care to fall your point, and with all thruſt him out, if your enemie doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach or preſſe in vpon you, whether it bee vpon choller, or vpon ſtomake, or vpon a kinde of fooliſh bold hardineſſe, or if hee make a paſſage vpon you, or if hee doe breake diſtance by anie of thoſe waies, although hee doe it neuer ſo actiuelie, yet may you defend your ſelfe with your Dagger and either of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your enemie by a ſuddaine falling the point, and with the ſame motion chop in with a thruſt to that part which lieth moſt diſcouered as you may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1116:63"/>perceiue when you ſee his lying.</p>
               <p>The cunningeſt man that is, and if hee meete with one skilfull, with whom hee is to encounter withall, cannot before hand ſay in ſuch a place I will ſure hit thee; no more, then a gameſter when he goeth to play can ſay before he beginne, that hee will ſure win, for if he doe, he may be prooued a lier if his cunning were neuer ſo good.</p>
               <p>So that before hand you cannot determin where to hit your enemy, but when you ſee your enemies gard, then it is eaſie to iudge where it is open, if thou knoweſt a cloſe gard thy ſelfe, for hee which cannot write himſelfe, can giue but ſmall Iudgement whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another write well or ill, and if thine enemie doe incroach within thy diſtance, then bee doing with him betimes in the verie inſtant of his motion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be motion of his body, or the motion of his weapon, or in the motion of both together: put out thy point, but not to farre, but as thou maieſt haue thy rapier vnder command for thy owne defence, and alſo to prouide him ready againe to make a full thruſt home vpon a greater aduantage, for if thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere a ful thruſt home, in the inſtant of thy enemies aſſault, thou maieſt endanger thy ſelfe if thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doe falſifie his thruſt, and therefore make your thruſt ſhort at the firſt, or if your enemie doe beare his points anie thing abroad, then you may fall in betwixt them, either to his face or breaſt, or if his fore foote ſtand two foote diſtant or leſſe from the other if hee ſtand not cloſe, then you may hurt him in the knee or legge, either with thruſt or blow as hee ſtandeth in his guard without anie danger to your ſelfe, and that is no killing place.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1116:67"/>come home or not, but hee which doth thruſt it, if the defence were neuer ſo skilfull, but now the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to defend a falſe thruſt, is with the ſingle Rapier, for when that the Dagger falleth to cleare the fained thruſt from the body, then the Rapier muſt ſaue the vpper part, I meane the face and ſhoulder, by bearing him ouer your bodie as you doe at the ſingle Rapier, and ſo by that meanes the Rapier will defend all the bodie ſo low as your knee. By falſe play a Rapier and Dagger may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter againſt a Sword and Buckler, ſo that the Rapier man be prouident and carefull of making of his aſſault, that hee thruſt not his Rapier into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Buckler: but the falſe play to deceiue the Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, is by offering a fained thruſt at the face of him that hath the Buckler, and then preſently put it home to his knee or thigh, as you ſee occaſion; for he will put vp his Buckler to ſaue his face, but can not put him downe againe before you haue hit him, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe you may proffer or faine a thruſt to the knee of the Buckler man, and put it home to his buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhoulder, or face; for if hee let fall his Buckler to ſaue below, hee can not put him vp time enough to defend the vpper parts of his body with his Buckler, but muſt truſt for his defence, to his ſingle Sword: wherefore it behooueth euerie man to be skilfull in the Backe-ſword. The beſt way to make a falſe thruſt, is to ſtrike it downe by the out-ſide of your enemies Rapier hand, but not to thruſt it home, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bring vp the point of your Rapier, and thruſt it home to his left ſhoulder; for if you thruſt the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thruſt within the compaſſe of his Dagger, then it may be he will hit the point of your Rapier, in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1116:68"/>to breake the fained thruſt; and if he doe but touch your Rapier in your firſt proffer, then you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recouer your point to put home your ſecond thruſt, before hee hath recouered his guard, and ſo will preuent you: therefore, if you doe make a falſe thruſt, preſent it without the circle or compaſſe of his Dagger, that in his defence he may miſſe the hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of your point, then hath hee but the ſingle Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier to defend your ſecond thruſt, and he muſt make his preparation firſt before hand with his Rapier, if ſuch an occaſion be offered, otherwiſe it cannot be defended.</p>
               <p>Now there be diuers other guards to be vſed at the Rapier and Dagger, but moſt of them wil aske a great deale more practiſe, to be perfect in, then this firſt guard, and yet not anie one of them more ſeuere for defence both of blow and thruſt then this firſt guarde is, and therefore I doe account it the maſter guard of all other, yet in a Schoole, to make change of your play, then the more guard the more commendable, ſo they be performed with diſcretion and iudgement: therefore I haue deſcribed thoſe which I thinke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, although not ſo at large, as heereafter you ſhall haue them in a ſecond booke; for at ſome times, and for ſome purpoſes, one guard may better ſerue then another: for change of guards may croſſe ſome mens play, whereas if you vſe but one guard, may in often play be worne threed-bare, therefore learne as many faſhions of lying with thy weapons as thou canſt, and then in thy often practiſe make triall which thou doſt fit beſt withall, and that repoſe thy ſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at thy moſt neede: for I haue knowne many that could well defend themſelues at one gard better then

               <p>Now if your enemy doe lie on this croſſe guard, you may proffer a fained thruſt at his breaſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put it into his Dagger ſhoulder on the out-ſide

Againe, if you make the firſt proffer, and your enemy lying in this guard, then, ſo ſoone as you haue made your thruſt at him, preſently let fall the point of your Rapier to the ground-ward, lifting vp your Rapier hand, and defend his anſwere with your Rapier, by ſtriking it outward, I meane towards your right hand, ſo that his thruſt may goe cleare on your right ſide, for your Dagger will not defend your enemies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſo well as your Rapier, eſpecially vpon this guard.</p>

                  <p>If your enemie cloſe with you after this manner, and doe offer the But-end of his Staffe vnto your face or breaſt, then fall backe with your fore foote, and make a quicke change, and you ſhall haue him at great aduantage, both for defence and likewiſe to turne in the But-end of your Staffe vnto his face or breaſt, and if you liſt this is a ſure defence for ſuch an aſſault, beleeue it, for I know it, he that is perfect in the low guard, may with a Staffe encounter againſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1116:89"/>the Welch-hooke, Holbert, Partizan, or Gleaue, and I hold that a Staffe with a Pike to haue oddes againſt any ſuch long weapon, being equally matched in length, for oddes in length with any weapon is verie much aduantage, where I wiſh if any doe appoint the field with any of theſe aforeſaid weapons, it is not amiſſe for the one of them to condition to bring a hatchet or ſome other edged toole into the field to cut the longeſt ſtaffe, except you match them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.</p>

                  <p>Indeed without cunning and skill, the Welch-hooke, and theſe other weapons are more fearefull vnto the ignorant, but hee that is cunning in the falſe play and ſlippes, belonging vnto the Staffe may with a falſe thruſt or with ſlipping his blow endanger any other, being weaponed with any other of theſe weapons aforeſaid. For if you falſifie your thruſt according to my direction in the falſe play, that is, to proffer your thruſt on the one ſide, and then to put home the ſecond determined thruſt vnto the other ſide of his weapon, and then if your enemy haue a Hooke, Halbert, or Bill in defending the falſe, the head of his weapon will ſo ouer-carrie him by the reaſon of the weight, that hee cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him nimbly backe againe, whereby to defend the falſe, if your enemy bee armed with a Hooke, Holbert or Partizan or Gleaue, if hee charge you with a blow, then ſlippe his blow, either by plucking
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1116:89"/>in of your Staffe, keeping of the point vpright vntill his blow be paſt, and then you may anſwere him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, either with blow or thruſt, for by ſlipping a blow, the weight of the head of any of theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid weapons will goe with ſuch a ſwing that it will turne his body in a manner round, I meane beyond the compaſſe of defence.</p>
                  <p>Againe if you thinke that your face is out of his reach, he which chargeth you with a blow with any of theſe aforeſaid weapons, you may let fall the point of your ſtaffe, ſo that his blow may paſſe cleere ouer your ſtaffe, and ſo choppe home a thruſt withall vnder your enemies weapons, and then recouer the point of your Staffe vp haſtily againe.</p>

                  <p>I ſtill commend the low guard for any long wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, whether it be Staffe, Pike, Hooke, Halbert, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan or Gleaue, my reaſon is the point being ſo high as your head, and the But-end ſo low as your thigh, then is your weapon more readier to defend either blow or thruſt, if you bee charged neuer ſo ſodainely, whereas if your point hang downe-wards toward the ground, you can neuer lift him vp quick againe to defend your thruſt, but a blow may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended eaſily, for that a blow commeth more leaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, for why it is fetcht with a greater compaſſe, and a thruſt goeth with farre more celerity then a blow, being put in cunningly, but of theſe weapons ſhall follow more at large in the ſecond booke.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1116:90"/>
                  <p> Now if thy enemie haue oddes in length in his Staffe, then let thy enemie make the firſt aſſault, and vpon defence of his aſſault ſteppe forth with thy hindermoſt foote, and ſo thou ſhalt gaine ſixe foote at the leaſt in reach, but if your ſtaues bee both of one length, then vpon a charge or anſwere, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in onely with thy fore foote, and ſtand faſt with thy hinder foote, onely to plucke backe thy body againe, and if thou make the firſt aſſault, and thy enemie defend it, and ſo hee make a ſodaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, then it wilbe hard to recouer vp thy ſtaffe into his place, to defend it according to the low guard: but for a ſodaine ſhift the beſt defence is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your vpper-hand ouer your body, and letting your point fall to the ground, according to the olde common order of the fight with the Pike, at ſingle hand, I meane, hand to hand, or I may ſay, man to man.</p>

                  <p>I hold the low guard beſt, charging thy point di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the enemies breaſt, and alwaies haue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard, that thou poffer nor a blow, for ſo hee may defend it double on the Back-ſword and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and runne in vnder the Staffe, likewiſe if thou proffer a thruſt, let not thy Staffe looſe out of thy fore-hand, but hold him faſt, that thereby thou maiſt bee the more readie to charge him againe, and againe if hee encroach in vpon thee, for if thou let
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1116:90"/>goe one hand, then may thy enemie very well defend the thruſt of a ſtaffe, according as I haue directed in the deſcription of the Rapier and Dagger, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtaffe, for with that one defence, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in it, thou maiſt endanger any Staffe-man, that is not wary, and withall, well experienced in both theſe weapons, ſo that thou take thy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity vpon his aſſault, I mean in anſwering him quick, ſo ſoone as you haue defended his aſſault, whether it be blow or thruſt.</p>
                  <p>Now if thy enemie doe ſtrike at the point of thy Staffe, thinking to cut him off, then, as you ſee his blow comming, let fall the point of your Staffe, and preſently chop home a thruſt, for in ſo doing his blow will flie ouer your Staffe, as by your practiſe you may be perfect in this ſlippe, for ſo wee call it. I haue knowen a man with a Sword and Dagger hath cut off the end of a Pike-ſtaffe, but I hold him an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and an vnskilfull man, that hath held the ſtaffe, for though I hold, that a man skilfull at the Sword and Dagger may encounter againſt a reaſonable Staffe-man, the ſame opinion I hold ſtil, and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thou ſhalt heare; if extreame need require, and vpon a neceſſity, then the beſt meanes is to be vſed wherfore to be furniſhed with the beſt means before hand at the time of neede, it may greatly ſtead thee, for euery common man hath not knowledge of the beſt rule, except hee haue learned it and practiſed it by thoſe which could ſhew it, for it commeth not by nature to none, yet euery ignorant dunce, when hee is perſwaded to goe learne skill, will ſay, when I am put to my ſhift I will doe the beſt I can: ſo a man may, and yet without skill bee killed, although
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1116:91"/>hee doe his beſt, my opinion further of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Now the beſt guard with a Sword and Dagger, or Rapier and Dagger againſt a Staffe, is this, put your Dagger on the in-ſide of your Rapier or Sword, and ioyne them both together, making your croſſe with them within a foote or thereabouts of the hilt of your Rapier or Sword, and looking cleere with both your eyes vnder them, or betwixt both your weapons, and then if your enemy charge you with a blow at your head with his Staffe, beare them both double againſt the blow, and hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it, turne your point and turne your knuckles inward of your right-hand, and ſo to goe in amaine vpon him.</p>
                  <p>But if hee charge you with a thruſt, then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let fall the point of your Rapier downe-ward, and force him downe the more ſtronger, and more quicker with your Dagger, for to that end I doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point you to put your Dagger in the in-ſide of your Rapier or Sword. Loe in this manner you may defend either blow or thruſt of the Staffe, yet I muſt needes confeſſe, there is great oddes in the Staffe, if the Staffe-man bee verie skilfull, but otherwiſe the Rapier and Dagger hath the oddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with skill.</p>

               <p>THis thruſt is to be defended two waies, the firſt is to beare him againſt your enimies proffer, but haue a care that you doe not ouer-beare him, ſo that if he mock you with his fained thruſt on the one ſide, you muſt quicklie bring your ſtaffe backe againe into his place, to meet him when he commeth on the other ſide of his ſtaffe, and ſo to defend it, keeping your point vpright: now the ſecond defence is to beare your ſtaffe ouer your bodie againſt his proffer, as you doe againſt euerie ordinarie thruſt; for you muſt ſuppoſe that euerie thruſt will come home, for the defender doth not know if his enimy doe proffer a thruſt, whether it will come home or not: therefore (as I ſaid) you muſt beare your ſtaffe againſt euerie thruſt, but you ſhould beare your ſtaffe but a foote out of his place, whether it be againſt blow or thruſt: for if you ouer-carrie him, you can not recouer him to defend neither blowe nor thruſt, if it be falſified vpon you. Now if your enemie doe falſifie vpon his firſt proffer, carrie your ſtaffe ouer your bodie, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the point vpright againſt his firſt proffer: now vpon your offer of defence, at the firſt you ſee that you make no ſeiſure vpon his ſtaffe, then preſently you may perceiue he doth but dallie with you, onlie to deceiue you with falſe play, but then your proffer of defence, both for the true and falſe play, muſt be all done with one motion; for if you ſee that with the firſt proffer aboue he ſhorten his thruſt, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it home, then turne downe the point of your ſtaffe towards the ground, and meete him below, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1116:92"/>ſo ſtrike it away, but be ſure that you defend alwaies before hand, for to ſtrike it backeward is no ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Yet to make this fore-hand defence plainer, why then it is thus meant, if your right hand be placed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in holding your ſtaffe, then you muſt defend both the true play, and the falſe towards your left hand, but you muſt not defend the firſt proffer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the next, which may bee the falſe thruſt, backe-ward, but both muſt be defended towards your left ſide: and ſo likewiſe, if your left hand be formoſt, then frame your defence towards your right ſide, as before ſaid.</p>
               <p>Now if you cannot change hands, as (it may be) your enemie can, then keepe your guard vpon that and which you can beſt vſe, and you ſhall finde that hee hath very little oddes after you haue practiſed it a while; for you may offer or defend anie falſe play ſo well as if you lay croſſe handed one to the other.</p>

               <p>If your enemie charge you with a blow, defend your ſelfe, by bearing the edge of your Sword againſt it, and alittle beare your Dagger againſt the blow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, onely to giue allowance for the yeelding of your Dagger, if the blow ſhould chaunce to light at your head, for your guard ſimply of himſelfe doth defend but a weake blow; if you ſtand ſtocke ſtill at your gard as a wriſt blow a droppe or a mite, which commeth with ſmall force, though they come with more ſpeed then any other blow, your guard will defend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moouing your weapons.

               <p>Now (as I haue ſaid before) you muſt be carefull in your defence, and ſo ſoone as you come within the reach of your enemie, prepare your ſelfe into

               <p>Alſo there is a backe blow which is to be made two waies, the one is a plaine Dunſtable way, that is, to fetch thy ſword fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off thy left ſhoulder, &amp; ſo to ſtrike it to the right ſide of thy enimies head, or to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of his right leg, but the cunningeſt way is to bow thy Sword-elbow ioynt, &amp; with thy knuckles vpward, and thy Sword hilt ſo high as your eare, and then by turning of your ſword hand wriſt, bend, or proffer the point of thy Sword with a blow towards your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Dagger eare, but preſently turning your wriſt, bringing the middeſt of your Sword cloſe ouer the crowne of thy head, and with a compaſſe blow, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it home to his Sword eare, or to the outſide of his legge: I cannot with wordes make this blowe ſo plaine as I would, for I would gladly the ignorant ſhould vnderſtand it, for of all the blowes of true play, this is the beſt, for you may likewiſe faine it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the out-ſide of your enemies head, and ſtrike it home to the other, or vnto his ſide.</p>

               <p>IF your enemie be in this guard, as I haue heere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by falſe play, you may cauſe him to open his guard, but if he lie vpon any other guard, then you neede not to falſifie, for you may hit him with true play.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1116:98"/>
               <p> If you would hit your enemie on the right ſide of the head, then ſtrike a blow to his foote, but ſtrike it ſomewhat ſhort, then preſently bring it with a back blow to his right eare, the which wil be vnguar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by reaſon of the carrying his Sword to ſaue his left ſide, if hee be not the better grounded with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>And if you would hit him on the ſide of his head, then thruſt a full thruſt at his bellie, turning your knuckles inward, and hee will put downe his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to defend it, but then, ſo ſoone as you haue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your thruſt, preſently bring vp your Sword cloſe vp by the out-ſide of his Dagger elbow, and with a wriſt blow ſtrike him on the eare or head, keeping your knunckles inward, till the blow be deliuered: with this blow you may hit a good Player, but indeed it is not a very ſtrong blow.

               <p>Another way is to ſtrike a backe blow ſtrongly to his Sword eare, and preſently fall it downe to his foote, for hee ſeeing it come to his head, not one in twentie, but will wincke, and before he open his eies againe, you may hit him vpon his foote or legge.</p>
               <p>But the chiefeſt blow of all for the legge, is to lift vp the heele of your Sword hand higher then your head, and tip in the point ouer your enemies Sword, as though you would hit him in the right eie, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bring downe your Sword with a full blowe to the in-ſide of his legge, for this blow in offering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft

               <p>Yet there is another deceitfull blow for the legge or foote, that is, to ſtrike a backe blow to the ſword care (as before-ſaide) ſtepping out your foote with our blow alittle, and ſee that your blow reach but to his Sword, it is enough, but haſtily plucke backe your foote, and your Sword in their place, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide to charge him with a blow to the foote, as hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in to anſwer your firſt blow: now in ſtriking at his legge, be alittle before hand; for as he maketh a motion of lifting vp his Sword to charge you, ſtep in with the ſame motion, and in falling your point to his legge, you ſaue your owne legge, if he do ſtrike at your legge, then the Dagger muſt at ſuch a time, defend your head ſingle, which you may very well doe, if you beare him alittle the higher, but withall, turne the Dagger point downe towardes the right ſhoulder.</p>
               <p>Alſo, you may deceiue ſome, with caſting your eies downe, and looking to his foote, and preſently ſtrike it home to his head, for with your eie you may deceiue him which is not perfect in this deceit.</p>

               <p>The firſt is to remember to frame thy ſelfe into thy guard, before thou come within thy enemies
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1116:101"/>diſtance, and ſo to approach in guarded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, remember if thy enemy charge thee with a blow, at what weapon ſoeuer,<note place="margin">Be conſtant and ſteady in a good guard bee ſlow to make play ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe vpon thee.</note> yet anſwere him with a thruſt preſently, after you haue borne the blow double, according to my direction, following the firſt picture, but if thy enemy charge thee with a thruſt, then anſwere him with a thruſt at the neareſt place, which lieth moſt vnguarded, whether it be his knee or in his making play, your anſwere may be to his right arme, ſhoulder or face, all which you ſhall finde vnguarded in time of his profer, now if he haue a cloſe hilted dagger, yet with a falſe thruſt thou maiſt hit him in the Dagger-arme if he fight not very warily, or elſe in the Dagger-hand if hee haue not a cloſe hilted dagger.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let not fury ouer-come thy wits, for in a made fury skill is forgotten, for he which is in drinke or ouer haſty, ſuch a one in his anger doth neither thinke vpon the end of killing, nor feare to bee killed.</p>
               <p>Now the fourth and laſt which ſhould haue beene the firſt, is to remember to keepe a true diſtance, and if thy enemie doe gather and incroach in vpon thee, charge him with a thruſt, although thou put it not home, for a thruſt will feare him, and he which is in his right wits will be loath to come within the reach, or danger of thy weapon, but if thou ſuffer thy enemy to come within thy diſtance, then if thou haddeſt all the guards in the world, and yet ſtand ſtill without making play, hee will hit thee in ſpight of thy teeth, wherefore be doing with him betimes; and he will retreate and fall away from thee for his owne eaſe, Loe his I wrote, becauſe I would not haue thee in

               <p>IN deſcribing of this weapon I ſhall account the time ill ſpent, yet becauſe Short ſwords are in vſe and worne of many that would leaue them off if that they knew what an idle weapon it were, I meane to encounter againſt a long Sword and Dagger, or a long Rapier and Dagger, ſo ſmall is their Iudgement, but onely this, many of them will ſay it is a better weapon then any of the two foreſaid weapons are, but in my minde they may aſwell ſay that chalke is cheeſe becauſe they are both white, for I haue had much triall and great practiſe with the ſhort ſword, yet could I neuer find, nor neuer wilbe perſwaded but that a Rapier foure foote long or longer, hath ſuch great oddes, that I neuer meane to arme my ſelfe with a ſhort againſt it; for in my minde and by experience I ſpeake it, there is ſmall skill to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſhort ſword to encounter as aforeſaid, but onely reſolution and courage.</p>
               <p>He that is valiant and venturous, runneth in, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king diſtance, if hee eſcape both in his going in, and in his comming our vnhurt; from a man skilful, in my minde it is as a man would ſay chance-medly, for if I haue the Rapier and Dagger, I will hazard both games, and ſet againſt any man that holdeth the ſhort ſword to be a better weapon, although that <hi>George Giller</hi> hath moſt highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the ſhort ſword &amp; dagger, yet one Swallow maketh not a Summer, nor two Woodcocks a Winter, if a thouſand more were of his opinion, yet without all doubt there is a great
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1116:103"/>deale more danger then at Rapier and Dagger, for he that fighteth with a ſhort ſword muſt aduenture in pell mell without feare or wit, but I haue ſeldome heard or ſeene any fight with ſhort ſword and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, although they be each weaponed alike, but one or both commeth home moſt grieuous wounded: my reaſon is the diſtance is ſo narrow that a man can hardly obſerue it, except they haue beene both prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioners a long time before hand, for if a man practiſe continually long ſword or long Rapier, yet vpon ſuch a Challenge goeth into the field with a ſhort ſword, then the daunger is greateſt of all: aske <hi>Auguſtin Badger,</hi> who ſpeaketh highly in praiſe and commendation of the ſhort ſword, for hee hath tried that weapon in the field ſo often, and made as many tall fraies as any man that euer I heard of or knew ſince my time, yet hee will ſay that he neuer fought in all his life: but was ſore and dangerouſly hurt.</p>
               <p>I haue knowen ſome beſides my ſelfe, that haue fought with Rapier and Dagger twenty times, and haue neuer had one droppe of bloud drawne, and yet were accounted men of ſufficient vallour and reſolution, thoſe which weare ſhort ſwords depend onely vpon the taking of their enemies point, which is not to bee done if they meete with one that is skilfull: I haue heard many ſay in talking familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning this weapon, if I take the point of your long Rapier, then you are gone, but that is not to be done if thou meete with one that is skilfull except thou canſt take thy enemies point in thy teeth, otherwiſe thou canſt neuer make ſeaſure vpon his point, if hee bee skilfull as aforeſaid, but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1116:103"/>indeed it is an eaſie matter for a man skilfull to take the point of one that is altogether vnskilfull; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not anſwer thy enemy vntill thou be better wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, there are all theſe excuſes to bee framed as in the tenth Chapter of the treatiſe, there you may find excuſes fit for ſuch as weare ſhort Swords, if thou like them not I refer to thy owne wit to frame an excuſe; for ſome ſhift he muſt haue that weareth ſuch an idle weapon, for in a word a ſhort ſword and dagger to encounter againſt a skilfull man with rapier and dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I hold it a little better then a tobacco-pipe, or a foxe tayle, but yet a ſhort ſword is good to encounter againſt a ſhort ſword.</p>
               <p>Alſo a ſhort ſword is good to encounter againſt a naked man, I mean a man vnweaponed, and it is good to ſerue in the wars on horſe-backe or on foote, yet a Rapier will doe as good ſeruice in the wars as a ſhort ſword, if a skilfull man haue him in hand: we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers examples of thoſe which come out of the field ſore wounded, and they will ſay it was becauſe their enemy had a handfull or a foot ods in length of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vpon them; wherefore I ſay one inch is great ods and enough to kill a man, if they both haue skill alike, and doe obſerue a true diſtance: yet now you that are as it were married vnto ſhort ſwords, becauſe ſome will not giue their bable for the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though another doe not eſteeme it worth two-pence, yet a man ſhall as well driue a dog from a peece of bread, as wreſt many from that fooliſh kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; againe a ſword whether he be long or ſhort, is more weariſome and more troubleſome then a rapier, for a ſword will weare out your hoſe and three paire of hangers, before a Rapier doe weare out one paire;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1116:104"/>but ſome doe weare their ſhort ſwords about their neckes in a ſtring, ſo that if they ſhould haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vſe him, he cannot ſo ready draw out his ſword vpon a ſuddaine, as he which weareth him vpon his thigh, but of this faſhion of wearing their ſwords, I wil not ſpeake much, becauſe I ſee it is almoſt left off, for a man may buy a girdle and hangers for ten groats, which will ſerue for thy Rapier two or three yeere, and a ſcarfe will coſt ten ſhillings, and yet be worne out in a fortnight; but I will ſay no more becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny giue it ouer for their owne eaſe, I holde a ſhort ſword for to encounter againſt a rapier very little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a tobacco pipe as aforeſaid, and ſo as I began I conclude, yet behold a little helpe for him that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it.</p>

               <p>But at any hand ſuffer your enemy to make the firſt aſſault, becauſe hee hath the aduantage in length of weapon, and if thy enemy do charge thee with a blow you may defend it vpon this hanging guard, but to turne vp the point of your ſword according to backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſword rule, &amp; if your enemy charge you with a thruſt, you may after ſeiſure made vpon his weapon with your ſword as before directed; you may preſently ſo ſoone as you are in with the hindmoſt foot turne vp your ſword point and thruſt, this offence you may performe without the helpe of your dagger, but yet haue a care to prepare your dagger in a readineſſe, leſt in your going in, your enemy doe alſo come in with you, and although you haue his long weapon at your command without any danger, yet may he ſtab you with his dagger, except your dagger be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to defend; for a thruſt of a dagger is as eaſie to be defended with a dagger, as any thruſt is of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weapon, but if the defender bee ouercome with fury, and ſo thruſt both together, then they both are endangered, but to deſcend is better then to offend, and to be offended againe vpright according to the rule of the backe-ſword, it your defence be vpon the hanging guard, then clapping vp your dagger and ioyne with him as it were in commiſſion with your ſword, and ſo defend the blow vpon both together, now if your enemy will not charge nor make any aſſault vpon you, then I aduiſe you not to gather nor encroach vpon him, except you were equally match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in weapon, for you muſt obſerue the diſtance which belongeth to your enemies long weapon for this guard or any other. For this guard is but for a

               <p>Now thoſe that do encounter together with ſhort ſword, to ſhort ſword, I wiſh them to frame their guard according to my former direction at the long ſword and dagger.</p>
               <p>If thou frame thy guard according to my former direction as it is here pictured, then if your enemy doth falſifie a thruſt, and you making account to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it with your Sword, as before, and in turning in your left ſide hee double a thruſt, he may endanger you greatly; wherefore it behooueth thee not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercarrie thy Sword vpon the firſt offer, but that you may recouer him backe into the place againe, ſo that if you haue a care if you miſſe the ſtriking by of his Sword on the one ſide becauſe of his falſifie, you ſhal meete with him on the other, and ſo defend your ſelf although you cannot anſwer whereby to offend him by reaſon of his falſifie, for vpon a falſe if you make anſwer, it will be very dangerous to both.</p>

A thouſand talents ſaid the Fidler. Why ſaid the King, Is not that out of thy head yet? thy Muſicke is quite out of mine, thou pleaſedſt my eares with thy muſick for the preſent, &amp; I likewiſe filled thy eares with a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſound of ſo much mony: to our matter againe.</p>
                  <p>A faire tongue, and kinde behauior winneth fauor, both with God and men, whereas thoſe which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gouerne their tongues are ſeldome at quiet: but always puniſhed or vexed with the Law, and troubles in the Lawe conſume much money, which with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion might be kept by gouernement of the tongue.</p>
                  <p>Now by the hieway, if a careleſſe roiſter in his own name require thee to ſtand, and by vertue of his owne warrant doth require thy purſe; in ſuch a danger, and in ſuch a caſe betake thy ſelfe to thy weapon, rather then truſt to thy tong: for to ſpeake faire vnto ſome in ſuch a caſe will auaile thee nothing at all, but yet for all that, a faire tongue is as a precious balme to beare

                  <p>Againe, it is not common to fee a tall man valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1116:108"/>and skilfull withall, but generally, little men are valorous although not skilfull, now if the tall man be skilfull, the little man muſt for his aduantage, ſuffer the tall man to proffer him play firſt, but then vpon the little mans defence preſently, with the ſame motion ſteppe forth with foote and hand, and ſo by a quicke anſwere endanger the tall man: now if the tall man be not skilfull, whereby to ſteppe forth with his hand and foote together, when hee maketh play to the little man, then the little man skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full herein, getteth three foote at the leaſt by anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring euery aſſault that the tall man maketh by ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forth with the foote and hand as beforeſaid: but this muſt be thy helpe and this muſt be thy care, though a little man alwaies ſuffer the tall man to make play firſt, eſpecially if he be skilfull, and then be nimble with the anſwere, ſtepping it home with thy foote and hand together, according to my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, following the firſt picture, for what thou wanteſt in reach, is gotten by thy comming.</p>
                  <p>There is another old ſaying going thus, a tall man is ſo faire a marke, that a little man skilfull cannot miſſe him, and a ſhort man is ſo little and ſo nimble, that if he haue but a little skill, a tall man cannot hit him for with his weapons, and a good guard in a manner hee will couer all his whole body with his weapons. Lo this is my opinion, I doe not ſay all other are of my minde, for there is an old ſaying goeth thus, ſo many men, ſo many mindes, what other mens opinions is, I haue not to doe withall, but this I can ſay of my owne knowledge, that I haue not knowen one tall man amongſt twenty, that hath good skill, nor ſufficient valour anſwerable vnto
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1116:108"/>their ſtatures, for tall men are more fearefull then men of a meane ſtature, for I haue ſeene the triall both in the warres and in ſingle combat; yet take me not vp before I bee downe, for I doe not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all tall men of perſonage, for ſo I ſhould greatly ouer-ſhoote my ſelfe, and greatly wrong many tall men of ſtature and vallour, and alſo of good reſolution, but yet all of them are not ſo, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I haue ſaid, it is to encourage little men of meane ſtature, hauing skill not to feare any man vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good occaſion, thoſe that ſpend their daies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out practiſing skil in weapons, ſo that when they are wronged they fall to wiſhing: oh I would to God I had skill in my weapon, for then would I anſwere the wrong that ſuch a man, and ſuch a man hath done mee, but I could wiſh ſuch vnskilfull to liue quiet, and not to maintaine any quarrell, leſt they looſe their liues for want of experience, as many of them haue done.</p>

                  <p>Then this briefely is my opinion, a ſtrong man hath great oddes at the gripe, or in a cloſe at any blunt weapon, but vpon the point of a ſharpe weapon, in fight a ſtrong man hath ſmall or no oddes at all of the little or weake man, wherefore I would not haue a little man bee afraide of a tall or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne man, no although he were farre bigger then a man, for in performance of any things to be done with weapons, there is no more to bee found in the beſt of them of great ſtature vpon triall, then is in

               <p>An eaſie way to weapon thy ſelfe at time of need.</p>
               <p>Let thy Rapier or Sword be foure foote at the leaſt, and thy Dagger two foote, for it is better haue the Dagger too long then too ſhort, and rather hard then ſoft, for a ſhort dagger may deceiue a skilfull man his defence, either of blow or thruſt: I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten knowen a ſoft dagger cut in twaine with a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier.</p>
               <p>Let thy Staffe of practiſe be ſeauen or eight foote, and better, button both thy foiles and thy ſtaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the practiſe with them, for otherwiſe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull may thruſt out one anothers eyes, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there was no harme meant, yet an eye may be loſt except the occaſion be preuented.</p>
               <p>To make your buttons take wooll or flocks, and wrappe it round in leather ſo bigge as a Tennis-ball, then make a notch within halfe an inch of your woodden foile or ſtaffe, but if it be an Iron foile, then let there be an Iron button riuetted on the point, ſo broad as two pence, and then take your button being made as beforeſaid, and ſet it on the end of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1116:109"/>your Staffe or Foile likewiſe, and then take leather and draw hard vpon it, and binde it with Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers-ends or parck-thread in the notch, and another leather vpon that againe, for one leather may bee worne out with a little pracliſe.</p>
               <p>Now if thou haue a quarrell and willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and being not furniſhed with a Rapier, then take a cudgell of what length thou wilt thy ſelfe, and make a ſhoulder within a handfull of the ende of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by cutting him halfe way through, and there binde the haft of thy knife, and ſo the ſhoulder will keepe him from ſlipping backe, and this is as ſure and as fearefull, and as good as a Rapier to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt a Rapier and Dagger, or a Sword and Dagger, ſo that you haue a cloſe hilted Dagger: likewiſe you may tie a point at the But-end of the Cudgell, to put in thy finger that thy Cudgell ſlippe not out of thy hand: this weapon I haue made good proofe of, but it was in another Country, where I could get no other weapon to my minde.</p>

            <p>Now my ſecond booke which is already in hand ſhall ſhew my iudgement, and the chiefeſt rules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto my practiſe at all theſe ſeuerall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, if death doe not preuent me before I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed my pretence, yet for doubt thereof, the defence of the Staffe with a Rapier and Dagger, or with Sword and Dagger I will giue thee a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which being practiſed it may ſtead thee as much as thy life is worth. I doe this the rather, and for becauſe that the Staffe is a weapon which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men doe carry, and with skill it hath great oddes againſt either of the two aforeſaid weapons, but yet becauſe euerie man which carrieth a weapon, hath the perfect skill in that weapon which hee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, but admit that he hath good skill, yet in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt Defence, it may preuent thee from a danger.</p>
            <p>Now thou muſt remember if thou bee charged vpon with a Staffe, ſuddenly ſummon vp thy wits in that which before hand thou haſt learned for thy Defence, and thinke this with thy ſelfe; I am now to encounter againſt a Staffe: why then thus frame thy guarde, put thy Dagger acroſſe on the in-ſide of thy Rapier or Sword, and let the croſſe bee made within halfe a foote of thy Rapier or Sword-hilt, bearing vp both thy hilts euen ſo high as thy cheeke, looking with both thy eyes betwixt both thy weapons.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1116:111"/>
            <p> Thus being guarded, it may bee, that thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie will charge thee with a thruſt, for becauſe thy breaſt will ſeeme moſt open to him, the which and if hee doe, then turne downe the point of thy Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Sword, and with thy Dagger force him downe which will bee a ſtronger Defence then with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: and thus by turning downe both thy points together, ſtrike thine enemies thruſt of the Staffe towards thy right ſide: Loe, thus doe me with both thy weapons; then will thine enemies thruſt paſſe cleare vnder thy right arme, but neyther with the Sword nor yet with the Dagger alone; the thruſt of a ſtaffe is not to be defended without greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then with both of them, as before hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed.</p>
            <p>Now and if thine enemie doe chaunce to charge thee with a blow, thereby thinking to driue both thy Rapier and Dagger, or Sword and Dagger vnto thy head: For I haue knowne many to be of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with me. But the blowe of a Staffe, ſtrucke at the head, may be defended with the ſingle Sword or Rapier according vnto the Backe-ſword rule: but to beare thy Dagger with thy Rapier or Sword, that is the moſt ſure way, keeping both thy points vpright, and ſo to beare them towards the right ſide, or to thy left ſide, according as thou ſhalt perceiue thine enemie charge thee.</p>
            <p>Thus will I heere conclude and make an end with this ſhort direction concerning this one weapon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue ſpoken ſomething already touching and concerning this purpoſe, although it be not ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as now it is, and yet heereafter (by Almightie Gods good helpe) I will ſpeake more at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1116:112"/>of, this onely ſerueth but to rowze vp your ſpirites, that you may the better prepare your ſelfe for the next. The horſe ſtarteth at the Spurre, ſo (in loue) I pricke you forward in this commendable Art: and ſo, I hope, that this Whetſtone will make your blunt Wittes ſomewhat ſharper: Golde is not put in the fire to be conſumed, but to bee purified; euen ſo I hope, the trauell which I haue taken heerein will not make you to proue worſe, but rather ſomewhat the better in all goodnes.</p>

            <head>My farewell to Plimouth.</head>
            <p>MOST noble <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the great loue which I found in thee amongſt both rich and poore, now drawes me backe againe to giue thee a now drawes me backe againe to giue thee a kind and heartie farewell, and yet at this time I yeeld but onlie thanks as my pay- Miſtreſſe, but yet I deſire not to die indebted, without making ſome better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to ſome of my chiefeſt well-willers and friends, if my abilitie prooue anſwerable to my mind: for a Chriſtmaſſe banquet may be requited at Eaſter, and ſo when I am better able I will make amends; but yet me thinks I ſhould not leaue ſo famous a towne with ſuch a threed-bare fare-well, but here may a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ariſe of thoſe which know it not, why it ſhould be more famous then any other towne ? which I will tell thee, ſet her wealth and riches aſide, yet for that onlie not the like towne in this land of her bigneſſe, I meane ſo long as the wars continued, ſhe is alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for her ſtrong fortification, but more famous for her entertainment; for twentie thouſand ſtrangers haue had vpon a ſuddaine good and ſufficient lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and other neceſſaries; yea, whether they haue had mony, or not, but moſt famous of all for her gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant harbours, for a thouſand ſhippes may ſafely ride, and all within halfe a league of the Towne; it is the chiefe arriuing place for all the South and Weaſt Countries: and in a word, the onely Key of <hi>England.</hi> In the time of warres <hi>Plimmouth</hi> flowed, as it were, with milke and hony, and then it flouriſhed with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1116:113"/>Gallants great ſtore, tracing the ſtreetes ſo thicke in ſwarmes like as at <hi>weſtminſter</hi> in a Terme time, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many of them went away without bidding thee farewell; yet I will, as it were, bite thee by the finger, becauſe thou ſhalt remember me, for if it bee not poſſible for the mother to forget her childe, then (without all peraduenture) I ſhall neuer forget thee: Once thou wert a golden place, but now an yron or a leaden towne, I meane, in a manner turned vpſide downe, which makes me ſory, and many more; but yet be of good cheare, for after a ſtorme cometh a calme: plucke vp thy heart, and let it not grieue thee to ſee a King content with his kingdome; for if it were not ſo, it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>Although of late thy purſe hath had a ſtrong pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which maketh ſome of you to ſhrinke vp the ſhoulders like a Spaniard, and hang downe the head like a bull-ruſh, and repenting your ſelues, that you had not kept the goods better which you got in time of warres; and this mee thinketh I heare ſome of you ſay your ſelues: Oh what a foole was I that tooke not Time by the fore-locke before he did paſſe away, but muſt now catch at her balde pate, where is nothing to holde by: let it not grieue thee, for if thou hadſt thoſe goods againe, they would conſume like butter againſt the Sunne: for as it is not poſſible to keepe the Indian beefe ſweete two dayes, with all the ſalt in the world, no more is the goods got by the warres to be of any continuance, no although a man had them that were as wiſe as wit could make them, but it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome commeth into ſuch mens hands, but rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as reſemble <hi>Rufus</hi> the Ruffian which had God pictured on the in ſide of his Target, and the diuel on

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1116:114"/>what a ſtrumpet getteth of twenty, ſhee ſpendeth it vpon one which ſhee doth loue and affect aboue all the reſt: euen ſo, many ſouldiers and men of warre, what ſpoyles they get, they are not long in ſpending of it: but as the Prouerbe goeth, Light come, and light goe: ill got, and wickedly ſpent: for they put it into a bottomleſſe bagge, which neuer holdes thriſt long.</p>
            <p>Loe, thus my opinion you haue heard, and I yeeld vp my verdict thus, That the goods which is gotten by the warres, is ill gotten: and hee which hath but one peny worth of ill gotten goods in his houſe, God will ſend a curſe vpon all the reſt: then let vs pray for peace, rather then warres, and euery man learne to labor with his hands, to maintaine ſpending: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſet thy wittes and thy hands to labour, and turne ouer the leafe; I meane, learne a new leſſon, for looke what is gotten with labour, will bee ſpent with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, or elſe kept with warineſſe; and ſo I greete not onely <hi>Plimmouth</hi> alone, but all Deuonſhire and Cornewall, with as many kinde commendations, as it is poſſible for my Penne to expreſſe, and all I proteſt with true loue from my heart, and ſo I leaue you, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Farewells to you all.</p>

            <head>The Authors Concluſion.</head>
            <p>NOw (gentle Reader) I doe intreate thee to beare with my rudeneſſe, I am no Scholler, for I do proteſt I neuer went to Schoole ſix moneths in all my life, nor I neuer did write one line of this Booke by the direction of any other teacher; nor did I euer aske the opinion of any other Profeſſor, ſince the time that I was firſt taught, and that was when I was yong; and then I had ſome of my skil in <hi>London,</hi> and ſome in other places, where it was my chance to trauell. Againe, I did write this Booke by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale; for after I firſt beganne, I leſt off writing a weeke, and ſometimes a moneth together, before I writ againe; and ſo forgetting oftentimes what I had written before. Againe, ſome chiefe notes I haue left out, which I thought I had written of before: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall follow in my ſecond Booke. Now (Gentle Reader) for thy benefit I haue begunne, if there be any other that find fault, and cannot amend it, let them iudge of their wit that heare them talke: but if I ſhall heare thoſe my ſelfe ſpeake againſt this Booke which doe not goe about to amend it, then if they were as good as <hi>George a Greene,</hi> yet would I not be feared with deedes, much leſſe with words, but will anſwer them, not onely with words, but with weapons, for this Booke was printed in haſte, at the carneſt requeſt of ſome friends of mine. Alſo I wrote it to profite thoſe that can not come where Teachers are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and againe, there are few which teach this Arte
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1116:115"/>that doe trauell, the reaſon is, as I thinke, they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſet by when they come into the country amongſt you: Now it is not enough to haue this booke in thy pocket, but to exerciſe thy body with all, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou maiſt haue the perfect skill thereof in thy head, and ſo praying thee to excuſe me in the groſſe penning of it, and beare with me a little the rather in that I was neuer Scholler, as I ſaid before, and as it plainely appeareth by the groſſe penning of it, but my folly herein ſhalbe vpon my head, yet I pray thee let it paſſe a little the rather, and giue it your good word, for becauſe I haue taken paines in hope to doe thee good, but not for any gaine (I proteſt before God) but onely becauſe I know it ſo laudable an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and more commendable then any other, wee ſee daily theſe bookes ſcoffed at, which were made by learned and good Schollers, for if there were one which excell ten thouſand, yet euery one will not ſpeake well of him, but he ſhall haue in ſpight of his teeth back-biters and fault-finders, much more my ſelfe being the leſt of ten thouſand muſt not ſtabbe euery one which will ſpeake in diſcommendations, both of me and my Booke, but if I may eſcape hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which are vſually contemnors of ſuch laudable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: then I accompt that I haue made a good hand.</p>
            <p>For herein I haue ſhowen but my owne opinion and iudgement in ſetting out this booke, now I doe not ſay it is other mens opinions: for none but my ſelfe was counſell, nor had any hand in this matter; therefore I make no queſtion that other men are of other mindes, yet obſeruing theſe rules, and bearing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1116:115"/>theſe leſſons in memory, they may ſerue thy turne aſwell as they haue ſerued mine all the daies of my life hetherto: but yet beleeue what you liſt of it, and leaue what you like not, now if in my good intention and true meaning I bee vndeſeruedly wronged, I thinke it wilbe by none but ſuch pot-companions which cudgell there wits and beate their braines to ſhift for mony to that vſe which often-times makes the ſonne ſo hardy as to call his father knaue, or worſe.</p>
            <p>Now if my booke doe come vnto the view of any ſuch, I will impute it vnto the Idleneſſe of their braine, or vnto the ſpitefulneſſe of an enuious minde, which will neuer commend nor allow any other mans man-hood, opinion or iudgement to bee ſo good as their owne, not much like vnto the proude Pharizee, who ſaid that his life in all reſpect was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any other, now miſtake mee not, for I doe not ſay ſo, becauſe you ſhould thinke that this worke cannot bee mended, for it is farre from my thought to thinke that this booke is ſo wel penned as to be without fault, or to pleaſe all, neither is it ſo wel as it might haue beene, if my leiſure would haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to amend ſome faults which I know in it my ſelfe, indeed, I muſt confeſſe that there are many in this land of this noble and worthy art beſides my ſelfe, which might haue taken this matter in hand, becauſe many of them are more fit both for wiſdome and learning, but I ſee they haue not gone about it, wherefore if any blame me for ſhewing my good will, I hope thoſe which haue knowen mee and ſeene my behauiour wil anſwere for me with reaſonable ſpeech
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1116:116"/>againſt thoſe which obiect againſt me: no, if reaſon will not rule them, but like <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, will ſtriue againſt weapons, then I pray you referre the quarrell vnto my ſelfe, and let me anſwere my owne wrong which I haue done them heerein, for I had rather looſe my life in defence of my reputation and credit, if there were ſuch a danger in fighting, then my friend ſhould looſe one drop of bloud in my quarrell: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while I am liuing, wrong me not, for hee which fighteth for another, ſeeketh his owne deſtruction, ſo praying you if I haue offended any, let me anſwere it my ſelfe while I am liuing, for when I am dead hee deales vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianlike, that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe me: and ſo I reſt,</p>
